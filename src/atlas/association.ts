/**
 * Atlas Phase 1 — the association registry.
 *
 * An `Association` records that two things SHARE something: a constant, a
 * symbol, a structure, or a line of historical influence. That is the whole of
 * its meaning. It asserts **no relation** between the two, makes **no
 * composite claim**, and is explicitly NOT a graph edge — design note §5: *"No
 * `Association` semantics beyond a registry of typed pairs — the registry is a
 * container in Sprint 1, and it makes no composite claims."*
 *
 * The distinction is the point. `CATALOG_GRAPH` edges are claims that one
 * quantity DETERMINES another. An association is the opposite epistemic act:
 * it is where the atlas writes down a resemblance it has already decided is
 * NOT a link, so the resemblance stops being re-surfaced as if it were fresh.
 * An association that also appeared as an edge would be a contradiction, and
 * `tests/atlas/association.test.ts` pins that it never does.
 *
 * **The seed is the `'decoy'` half of the adjudication ledger.** A `decoy`
 * verdict means a physicist looked at `a ≟ b` and found a coincidence with no
 * mechanism — precisely a shared appearance with no relation behind it. Every
 * `'decoy'` row in `ADJUDICATIONS` (`src/composition/adjudication.ts`) gets
 * one entry here, id-linked, with its `grounds` copied VERBATIM as the `note`.
 *
 * **No new physics is added by this module**, and two deliberate choices keep
 * it that way:
 *
 *   - `note` is the adjudicator's own prose, never a restatement. Verbatimness
 *     is pinned by test against the live ledger, so a re-worded ledger entry
 *     fails rather than silently diverging from its copy here.
 *   - `kind` is assigned MECHANICALLY, not per pair. Every seed is
 *     `'shared-structure'` because every one of them reached the ledger the
 *     same way: the identification funnel pairs quantities that share a
 *     dimensional signature. Choosing a different `kind` per row would be a
 *     fresh physics judgement about each pair, which is exactly the claim this
 *     registry exists not to make.
 *
 * **Why the seed is written out rather than derived from `ADJUDICATIONS` at
 * import time.** `src/composition/` may import atlas TYPES only, never the
 * barrel, because a value import in the other direction closes a cycle
 * `docs:deps` reports (`compose.ts` already imports `atlas/composition-table`).
 * An `atlas → composition/adjudication → discovery → …` value import risks the
 * same cycle from the other side. So this module stays a leaf, and the
 * drift protection moves into the test, which is free to import both.
