/**
 * Atlas Phase 4, S4.1 — the applicability checker.
 *
 * Design note: `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-4-Design.md` §1.
 *
 * **This module answers "what about this bridge is not checked?", and it
 * returns FINDINGS rather than a boolean.** A boolean would have to choose
 * between "unchecked" and "wrong", and those are the two states the module
 * exists to keep apart. Every finding therefore carries a
 * {@link ApplicabilitySeverity}:
 *
 *  - `'blocking'` — the data CONTRADICTS ITSELF. A dimensional failure, two
 *    records declaring opposite conventions, a literal zero divisor.
 *  - `'question'` — the data is SILENT. A divisor nobody guarded, a convention
 *    only one side declares, two premise models whose relationship is
 *    unrecorded.
 *
 * `src/atlas/conventions.ts` already argues this asymmetry at length for the
 * convention comparison: absence is not disagreement. The same reasoning
 * governs every rule here. Collapsing the two severities would report "four
 * findings" for a record whose only defect is that nobody wrote something
 * down, and would bury a genuine contradiction among them.
 *
 * **Nothing here mutates a record and nothing here is a verdict.** The checker
 * has no authority to promote or reject: it produces the list a reviewer reads.
 * That is the same firewall the rest of the repo keeps — no machine verdict
 * mutates a catalog.
