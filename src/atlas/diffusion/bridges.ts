/**
 * Atlas Phase 4, S4.4 — the three bridges of the diffusion family.
 *
 * Design note: `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-4-Design.md` §4.
 *
 * | Bridge | Relation | Witnesses |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | random walk → Fick | `coarse-graining` | WD1 (convergence), WD1b (light cone) |
 * | heat ↔ Fick | `exact-equivalence` | WD2 (convergence), WD2s (CAS) |
 * | free Schrödinger → Fick | `analytic-continuation` | W5, WD3 (convergence), WD3b (norm) |
 *
 * Regime groups are DERIVED through `deriveRegimeGroups` and keyed by
 * `PiGroup.formula`; every inequality names one of those keys. The Fourier
 * number `D·t/ℓ²` appears as `kappa · rho^-1 · cp^-1 · ell^-2 · t` on the heat
 * side. **The Péclet number is not applicable to any model here**: it needs an
 * advection velocity, and none of the four models has one. It is stated as a
 * side condition (`no advection`) rather than invented as a group.
 *
 * Tolerances were set AFTER measuring each witness at several resolutions and
 * are stated in the witness records; `tests/atlas/diffusion.test.ts` asserts
 * the measured numbers.
