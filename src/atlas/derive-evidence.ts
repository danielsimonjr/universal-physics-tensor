/**
 * Atlas Phase 1, S1.3 — evidence tags, DERIVED AT READ TIME.
 *
 * Design note: `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-1-Design.md` §3 and §4.
 *
 * **The contract of this module: it has no write path.** No record stores an
 * evidence set; every tag is computed from the artifacts a record actually
 * carries, each time it is asked for. A tag is emitted ONLY when the artifact
 * it names is present and passing. There is no default-true tag, no tag
 * derived from another tag, no tag derived from `reviewStatus`, and no tag
 * derived from prose. A record carrying no passing witness derives exactly
 * `{'proposed'}`.
 *
 * ## The empty-set trap (design note §3, Adam A1 RED — confirmed by execution)
 *
 * `convention-checked` is the ONLY rule in the table whose quantifier is
 * universal (`every`). Written as "`conventions` is present AND every declared
 * field is consumed by a witness", it hands the tag to a record with ZERO
 * witnesses, because `conventions = {}` declares nothing and `[].every(…)` is
 * vacuously true. {@link deriveEvidence} therefore requires a NON-EMPTY
 * declaration before the universal runs, and
 * `tests/atlas/derive-evidence.test.ts` pins the empty-object case.
 *
 * **The general rule, for anything added here later:** a universal quantifier
 * in a tag derivation must be paired with a non-emptiness check, or the tag is
 * free. The other rules are existentials (`some`), which are false on the
 * empty set and therefore safe.
 *
 * ## What "passing" means, and why the caller supplies it
 *
 * `Witness` records an id and the test file that runs it; nothing on the
 * record says whether that test passed. Proving it is a filesystem act (see
 * `tests/atlas/evidence-rule.test.ts`, which matches witness ids against test
 * titles), and this module is pure. So the set of passing witness ids is an
 * ARGUMENT, and it is REQUIRED — {@link NO_PASSING_WITNESSES} must be passed
 * explicitly when nothing is verified.
 *
 * It used to DEFAULT to empty, which sounds conservative and was in fact a
 * defect (Eve E1 RED, confirmed by execution). Defaulting the other way, to
 * "all", would have been the free-tag defect above in a second location — but
 * defaulting to empty created the mirror-image failure: a forgotten argument
 * produced an answer identical to a real negative. A catalog-wide check written
 * that way could only ever report "no row gains evidence", whatever the rows
 * held, so it could not fail. Requiring the argument makes a vacuous result a
 * STATED choice, and `tests/atlas/coverage.test.ts` now carries a positive
 * control so that a negative result carries information.

 * | `'bridge'` | {@link deriveEvidence} runs normally |
 *
 * ## ⚠ `'not-a-bridge'` no longer forces `'contradicted'` (Eve E1, 2026-09-21)
 *
 * It used to, "regardless of witnesses", and that rule — written by me in design
 * note §4 — **violated §3 of the same document.** `contradicted` means THE CLAIM
 * IS REFUTED. `not-a-bridge` means THE ROW IS NOT A REGIME-CROSSING BRIDGE.
 * Those are different assertions about different things, and conflating them made
 * the library report BE-35 as `status: 'established'` and `evidence:
 * {'contradicted'}` in the same breath — from which a reader cannot tell whether
 * the equation is a true in-regime identity the bridge graph ignores, or a
 * refuted statement.
 *
 * Measured when the rule was removed: of the five rejected rows, only **BE-35**
 * carries an actual counterexample, and it derives `{'contradicted'}` NATURALLY
 * through the normal path. **BE-28, BE-29, BE-32 and BE-40 carry none** — the old
 * rule was manufacturing a refutation for four rows with no refuting artifact
 * whatsoever. That is exactly what §3 forbids: a tag is emitted only when the
 * artifact it names is present and passing.
 *
 * Membership already has a single owner — `adjudicateBridgeEntry` — and it does
 * not need restating in the evidence vocabulary. Removing the case leaves each
 * fact with exactly one source, which is what §4 was trying to achieve and this
 * rule was quietly undermining.
