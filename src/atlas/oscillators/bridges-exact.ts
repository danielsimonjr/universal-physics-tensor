/**
 * The two Phase 0 `exact-equivalence` bridges of design note §3.
 *
 * - `ab-spring-lc` — the lossless mechanical/electrical dictionary, exact with
 *   no side condition beyond positivity and losslessness.
 * - `ab-damped-rlc` — exact only ON a side condition: the two damping ratios
 *   must agree, `b/(2√(mk)) = (R/2)√(C/L)`.
 *
 * **Regimes carry no inequalities.** `RegimeInequality` expresses `<`, `<=`,
 * `>`, `>=` only, so the bridge-2 side condition — an EQUALITY between two
 * derived ratios — cannot be written as one. It is carried in
 * `sideConditions` as prose instead, and the equality is what witness W2
 * executes. Writing an inequality that merely resembles it would be a
 * fabricated constraint, so none is written. `groupDefinitions` is derived
 * from the premise and conclusion parameters by `deriveRegimeGroups`, exactly
 * as the models do; nothing there is hand-authored.
 *
 * **Evidence tags are witness-gated.** A tag appears only because a witness in
 * `tests/atlas/oscillators-exact.test.ts` passes and shows it.
