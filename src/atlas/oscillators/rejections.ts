/**
 * The Phase 0 REJECTION record: a claimed bridge the atlas records as refuted,

 *
 * `ax-cubic-spring-lc` claims the cubic (Duffing-type) spring
 * `m x″ + k x + β x³ = 0` is exactly equivalent to the LC circuit
 * `L q″ + q/C = 0`. It is not. The cubic spring's variable set
 * {m, k, β, x0} carries exactly ONE dimensionless group, `β x0² / k`, which
 * measures the nonlinearity and has no counterpart on the LC side: the LC
 * variable set is dimensionally independent and admits no group at all. A
 * surviving group with no image cannot be matched by any change of variables,
 * so no exact equivalence exists.
