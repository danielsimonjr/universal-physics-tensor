/**
 * The two Phase 0 APPROXIMATION bridges — design note §3, bridges 3 and 4.
 *
 * - `ab-pendulum-linear` — a REGULAR limit. `θ'' + ω0² sin θ = 0` reduces to
 *   `θ'' + ω0² θ = 0` as `θ0 → 0`. The order of the system does not drop, the
 *   error is `O(θ0²)` in the relative period, and the approximation is
 *   NON-UNIFORM in time: a fixed relative period error accumulates phase
 *   without bound, so the bound carries the horizon `t ≪ 16 T0/θ0²`.
 * - `ab-damped-massless` — a SINGULAR limit. `m x'' + b x' + k x = 0` reduces
 *   to `b x' + k x = 0` as `m → 0`. The order DROPS from two to one, one
 *   initial condition is lost, and the reduced model cannot satisfy `x'(0)`.
 *   The bound therefore holds only OUTSIDE the boundary layer, `t ≥ 5 m/b`.
 *
 * On the position offset of the singular bridge: `x_full − x_red` is an
 * `O((1 + |v0|) m)` deviation that PERSISTS THROUGHOUT THE OUTER REGION and
 * decays only on the slow time scale `b/k`. It is the matched-asymptotics
 * correction, not a boundary-layer transient, and waiting out the fast mode
 * does not remove it. (Design note §9 YELLOW (5) — "non-vanishing" was the
 * imprecise wording this replaces: the offset does go to zero as `t → ∞`.)
