/**
 * Atlas Phase 1 — convention comparison.
 *
 * `Conventions` (`src/atlas/types.ts`) records the sign and unit choices a
 * record depends on. Two records that disagree on one of those choices are not
 * directly comparable, and this module says WHICH keys disagree.
 *
 * **`undefined` is "unknown", never "mismatch", and that asymmetry is the
 * whole design.** A record that declares nothing about the metric signature
 * has not chosen `'+---'`; it has not said. Reporting the absence as a
 * disagreement would manufacture conflicts out of missing data — and because
 * almost every record in the repo declares nothing today, it would manufacture
 * them at scale. The same reasoning that makes design note §3 require a
 * NON-EMPTY `conventions` before `convention-checked` can be derived applies
 * in the mirror here: absence earns neither a tag nor an accusation.
 *
 * A mismatch is therefore reported only when BOTH sides declare the key and
 * the declared values differ.
 *
 * @module atlas/conventions
