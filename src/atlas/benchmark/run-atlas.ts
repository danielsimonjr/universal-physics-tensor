/**
 * Atlas Phase 5, S5.2 — the ATLAS condition of the invalid-bridge benchmark.
 *
 * Design note: `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-5-Design.md` §6.
 *
 * For each item the runner applies three atlas instruments — the applicability
 * checker (S4.1), the composition table (S3) and the regime check (S2) — and
 * emits `accept`, `reject` or `abstain`.
 *
 * ## The decision rule, and why accept is the HARDEST outcome to reach
 *
 * - **reject** when an instrument DEMONSTRABLY fires: a blocking applicability
 *   finding, a chain OVERCLAIMED as an exact equivalence, a structural analogy
 *   promoted to an equivalence, or a regime inequality checked and violated.
 * - **accept** only when EVERY instrument RAN and CLEARED: side conditions were
 *   stated, the applicability checker found nothing, the regime was supplied and
 *   every inequality was checked and held, and any claimed chain agrees with the
 *   table. S4.1 already fixed the principle: an empty finding list means "no rule
 *   fired", which is weaker than "valid". An item that leaves a check unrun has
 *   not been cleared by it.
 * - **abstain** otherwise. Abstention is a first-class outcome and is preferred
 *   to a wrong accept (ROADMAP Phase 5, pre-stated criteria).
 *
 * The failure kind a rejection names is a MAPPING from the rule that fired, and
 * it is only as good as that mapping: a dimensional inconsistency is reported as
 * `notation-collision` because that is its commonest cause, not because the rule
 * can see notation. The scorer grades "rejected" and "named the right kind"
 * separately, so an imperfect mapping costs the second score only.
