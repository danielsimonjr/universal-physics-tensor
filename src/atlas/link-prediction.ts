/**
 * Atlas Phase 6, S6.3 — link prediction over the typed model graph: ONE result,
 * stated as a hypothesis about the representation.
 *
 * Design note: `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-6-Design.md` §1.
 *
 * The graph: every model in every registered family is a node; every
 * premise→conclusion pair of every bridge is an undirected edge. The test is
 * leave-one-bridge-out: remove a bridge's edges, then ask each predictor to rank
 * the conclusion among every model not already adjacent to the premise. A hit is
 * the held-out conclusion inside the top k.
 *
 * - **structural predictor** — common neighbours in the remaining graph, ties
 *   broken by sharing the premise's family, then by id;
 * - **text baseline** — word-token overlap between the models' dynamics and
 *   state-space descriptions, ties broken by id.
 *
 * ⚠ **What this result cannot carry.** The graph is small (24 models, 22 pairs)
 * and was curated by the same agent that runs the test, in-distribution. It is a
 * statement about how this representation behaves on its own content — not a
 * discovery claim, not a hub or gap claim, and not evidence about physics the
 * atlas does not contain. ROADMAP Phase 6 asks for it as a hypothesis test, and
 * that is its whole scope. Product A (`src/composition/discovery.ts`) is not
 * touched: a test pins that nothing under `src/atlas/` imports it.
