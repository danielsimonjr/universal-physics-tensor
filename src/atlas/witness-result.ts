/**
 * Atlas Phase 4, S4.2 — the shape a witness run reports.
 *
 * Design note: `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-4-Design.md` §2.2.
 *
 * **The load-bearing distinction in this file: a check that DID NOT RUN is not
 * a check that FAILED.** Peer absent, budget exhausted, and parser throw are
 * all `'unresolved'`, each carrying the reason it could not answer. Only a
 * check that COMPLETES and finds a disagreement is `'refuted'`.
 *
 * This repo has been bitten by exactly that conflation more than once — a
 * checker that discarded its own stderr manufactured a false negative
 * indistinguishable from a clean pass. Folding "could not run" into "failed"
 * is the same defect with the sign flipped: it turns a missing optional peer
 * into a refutation of the physics.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. A runner that threw would force every caller into a
 * `try`/`catch` whose `catch` arm cannot tell which of the three outcomes it
 * is looking at.
