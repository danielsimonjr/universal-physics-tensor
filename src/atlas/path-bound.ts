/**
 * Routes through an atlas family, and the error bound a route carries.
 *
 * Two functions, and the second is the one that can do damage:
 *
 * - {@link findPath} is pure graph search. It answers "is there a chain of
 *   bridges from A to B", and nothing more. A path existing says NOTHING about
 *   whether that path supports a claim.
 * - {@link boundPath} answers "what error bound does this chain carry", and its
 *   default answer is NO BOUND. `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-2-Design.md` §3:
 *
 *   > A path containing any edge whose relation composes to
 *   > `'no-composite-claim'` has NO bound. It must return an explicit no-claim,
 *   > never a number. A composed number over an undefined composite would be
 *   > the most dangerous output this library could produce: precise-looking and
 *   > unfounded.
 *
 * So {@link boundPath} returns a DISCRIMINATED UNION, not a number. A caller
 * cannot read `.bound` off a no-claim, because a no-claim has no `.bound` — the
 * refusal is enforced by the type rather than by a documented convention.
 *
 * ## Norms — why an exact edge does not compose for free
 *
 * `./error-algebra.ts` states the rule this module obeys, and it is narrower
 * than it first reads:
 *
 * > An exact equivalence contributes `IDENTITY_BOUND` **in the norms these
 * > Phase 0 bridges state** — not in every norm.
 *
 * An `exact-equivalence` bridge carries no `bound`, hence states no `norm`. It
 * therefore contributes `IDENTITY_BOUND` in NO norm, and a path that mixes it
 * with a normed bound cannot claim the composite holds in that norm. That is a
 * `'norm-not-stated'` no-claim. The composed NUMBER would be unchanged —
 * composing with the identity is arithmetically a no-op — which is exactly what
 * makes the error invisible without this gate: the danger is not a wrong
 * magnitude, it is a right magnitude attached to the wrong norm.
 *
 * ⚠ **Correction to the S2.2 brief.** The brief states that no field records a
 * norm and that Phase 2 must add `norm?` to `ApproximationBound`. That is
 * out of date: `ApproximationBound.norm` already exists as a MANDATORY
 * `string` (Phase 0, `./types.ts`). No type change was needed, and this module
 * reads the field that is already there.
 *
 * **Uniformity is gated here, at use.** `ApproximationBound.uniformity` may
 * be `null` (or empty — the same state) so a real bound can be recorded
 * before anyone has analysed what the error is uniform in. Composing such a
 * bound would attach a number to an unanalysed claim, so {@link boundPath}
 * returns `'uniformity-unanalysed'` and does not compute one.
 * `propagateUncertainty` does not read the field and does not fold `delta`
 * into `sigma`: it stays a statistical-sigma function.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no registry reads.

 * The error bound a chain of bridges carries — or an explicit no-claim.
 *
 * Four gates, in this order. Each one is a reason to refuse, and the FIRST
 * reason found is the one reported; none of them is skippable by a caller.
 *
 * 1. **Relation.** `composeRelation` is folded along the path. The moment the
 *    running composite is `'no-composite-claim'`, the path has no bound. This
 *    is design note §3 constraint 1 and it is checked before any arithmetic,
 *    so no number is ever computed for a path that cannot carry one.
 * 2. **Uniformity.** Any bound whose `uniformity` is `null` or empty is not
 *    yet analysed. The path returns `'uniformity-unanalysed'` and no Lipschitz
 *    arithmetic runs. An edge with no `bound` — an exact equivalence, or an
 *    unbounded coarse-graining — does not fail this gate.
 * 3. **Lipschitz.** `composeBoundPath` folds the per-edge pairs. A `null` — an
 *    edge that is neither bounded nor exact — is tolerated only as the LAST
 *    entry, where it terminates the claim (`terminal: true`); anywhere else it
 *    throws `MissingLipschitzError` rather than inventing a constant.
 * 4. **Norm.** Every stated norm on the path must be the SAME norm, and no
 *    unnormed exact map may carry a normed claim. An `exact-equivalence`
 *    states no norm (it has no `bound`), so a path mixing one with a normed
 *    bound is `'norm-not-stated'` — see the module note.
 *
 * @throws RangeError on an empty path. Returning `IDENTITY_BOUND` for "no
 *   edges" would be a bound asserted about nothing.
 * @throws MissingLipschitzError via {@link composeBoundPath}; see gate 3.
