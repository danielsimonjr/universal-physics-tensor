/**
 * Atlas Phase 3 — the poster's sixteen entries, its five hidden supporting
 * nodes, and the three conservation statements its edges conclude in.
 *
 * ## The one rule this module exists to obey
 *
 * **Blueprint v2's Appendix A is NOT in this repo.** `ROADMAP.md` Phase 3
 * states the fifteen typed edge lines and the five hidden nodes in full, and
 * it references the sixteen entries BY NUMBER in identifying context — but no
 * file here maps number → name. Design note
 * `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-3-Design.md` §5 is explicit about what follows:
 * *"Transcribe or derive each entry from a stated source; never invent one to
 * fill a gap."*
 *
 * So every entry below carries an {@link Identification}, and it is a FIELD
 * rather than a comment because a comment cannot be tested. Three values:
 *
 * - `'derived'` — the edge lines pin it. `10 → 9` restriction with *"separate
 *   frame content in 9"*, `11 → momentum conservation … converse fails … fails
 *   naively when fields carry momentum`: those three lines are Newton's
 *   second, first and third laws and nothing else.
 * - `'partial'` — the lines pin a FAMILY but not the member. Entry 7 is a
 *   Maxwell equation (the line distinguishes it from *"the full Maxwell
 *   system"*, which is a hidden node — `never from 7 alone`), but which of the
 *   four it is, is not recoverable. Entry 5 is read here as `E = mc²`; see
 *   {@link POSTER_5_IDENTIFICATION_NOTE}.
 * - `'unidentified'` — entries 3 and 14, which `ROADMAP.md` names exactly
 *   once, in `3, 14 → * association only`. Nothing there identifies them. They
 *   are recorded as placeholders WITH THEIR NUMBERS and no physics, because a
 *   plausible guess would be uncheckable, and an honest gap beats it.
 *
 * **The edges do not depend on any of this.** Every record in
 * `./derivations.ts` and `./associations.ts` references entries by NUMBER, so
 * a mis-identified NAME cannot corrupt an edge type. That separation is
 * deliberate: the numbers come from a stated source, the names are an
 * inference over it, and only one of them is load-bearing.
 *
 * ## `ast?` is absent everywhere here, on purpose
 *
 * `statement.ts` §1 already argues it: the hidden nodes are valuable because
 * they are NAMED and LINKED, not evaluable, and requiring an `ast` would force
 * a fabricated encoding. The same holds for the sixteen — this module records
 * poster claims, not evaluable equations — so every statement here carries an
 * honest `sourceExpression` and no `ast`, and {@link buildPosterRegistry}
 * refuses one that carries an `ast` it cannot have earned.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O. Imports `../statement.js` and `../model.js` types only, so
 * this module is a leaf under `src/atlas/` and closes no cycle.
 *
 * @module atlas/poster/statements
