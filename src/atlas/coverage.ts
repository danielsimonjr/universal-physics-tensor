/**
 * Atlas Phase 1, S1.3 — evidence coverage, counted BY TAG.
 *
 * Design note `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-1-Design.md` §3: *"Any future commit
 * that appears to raise a row's evidence without adding a witness is a bug,
 * and the coverage report is what makes it visible: it reports counts BY TAG,
 * so a jump is legible."*
 *
 * A single "how many records have evidence" total would hide exactly the
 * movement this report exists to expose — one tag inflating while another
 * drains reads as no change at all. So the report is per tag, every tag is
 * present with an explicit zero, and `records` is reported beside the counts
 * (the counts do not sum to it: a record carries several tags).
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no catalog import, no caching — every function here takes
 * what it counts as an argument, so it can never disagree with a registry.
 *
 * @module atlas/coverage

 * this answers the different question "how much has anyone LOOKED at". The two
 * must not be conflated: a row can be `verified` (its derived tag set is
 * non-empty, which a machine check produces) while nobody has recorded a
 * `relation` for it at all.
 *
 * - `schema` — the denominator: the 55 catalog rows plus the canonical
 *   registry. The atlas families are NOT in it; they are reported separately,
 *   because a nine-model pilot would otherwise dilute a catalog-wide fraction.
 * - `audited` — a HUMAN set `relation` or `conventions` on the record.
 * - `verified` — a derived evidence tag set is non-empty. Passed IN, never
 *   derived here, for the same reason `summarizeEvidence` never derives.
 * - `notYetAudited` — `schema − audited`, stated rather than left to arithmetic.
