/**
 * Tiny pure builders for dimensional ASTs — `sym` (a symbol leaf) and `dim`

 * across the bridge-equation helpers, the canonical L1 builder, the
 * composition layer, and the formula transpiler; this module is their single
 * source of truth.
 *
 * Deliberately depends only on TYPES (`ExprNode`, `Dimension`), so it has no
 * runtime imports and can be imported from any layer without risking a cycle.
 * `_be-helpers` and `_l1-build` re-export `sym`/`dim` for their existing
 * importers, so most call sites are unchanged.
