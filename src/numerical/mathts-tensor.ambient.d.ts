/**
 * Ambient module declaration for the optional peer dependency
 * `@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor`. The package is listed in package.json's
 * `optionalDependencies` and is therefore not guaranteed to be installed at
 * tsc time — without this declaration, the static `import { Tensor } from
 * '@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor'` at the top of `numerical/mathts-engine.ts`
 * would fail tsc with TS2307 and need `@ts-ignore` (or skip the build
 * entirely in environments without the sister-repo dep installed).
 *
 * The declaration body is empty: `Tensor` resolves to `any` at type-check
 * time when this ambient is the only declaration available. With the
 * optional peer ACTUALLY installed (the maintainer's primary dev env),
 * `node_modules/@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor/dist/index.d.ts` takes
 * precedence and provides the real typing. The empty ambient is therefore
 * a *fallback* shim that makes the build robust to optional-peer-absence,
 * not a primary typing source.
 *
 * v0.6.1 Phase 0 cleanup: mirrors the v0.5.1 TS-4 precedent for
 * `mathts-autograd.ambient.d.ts`. Closes the build-fails-without-peer gap
 * caught at v0.6.1 sprint baseline (`tsc` failed at `src/numerical/engine-
 * registry.ts:43` and `src/numerical/mathts-engine.ts:13` with TS2307).
 *
 * @module numerical/mathts-tensor.ambient
