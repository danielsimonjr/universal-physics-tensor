/**
 * The POSTER source for the physics map — turn the Atlas Phase 3 poster index
 * (statements, derivations, associations) into {@link VizJunction}s, and check
 * that every id a derivation names actually resolves.
 *
 * ## The graph this draws is NOT the catalog graph
 *
 * In the catalog map, round nodes are *quantities* and box nodes are
 * *equations*. In the poster map, round nodes are **statements** — including
 * the five hidden supporting nodes (the action principle, Noether, the full
 * Maxwell system, the Lorentz group, the central limit theorem) — and box
 * nodes are **derivations**: many premises in, one conclusion out. That is the
 * whole reason a hidden node is visible at all: it is a node because something
 * names it, not because it can be evaluated (`atlas/statement.ts`, design note
 * §1, says `ast?` is optional for exactly these five).
 *
 * It also makes {@link validatePoster} able to FAIL. A hidden node that is
 * merely listed somewhere can never be contradicted; a hidden node that two
 * derivations take as a premise is contradicted the moment the registry stops
 * defining it. Design note §9 question 4 flags the named-but-not-evaluated test
 * as the likeliest vacuous pass in this sprint — the dangling-premise check is
 * the answer to it, and its own test breaks it deliberately to prove it bites.
 *
 * ## How a poster junction meets the map's filters
 *
 * Nothing here bypasses `buildVizModel`'s filtering: these junctions are handed
 * in as `opts.extraJunctions` and are judged by the same `judge` predicate as
 * every catalog edge (design note §6). Two consequences, both deliberate:
 *
 *  - A **derivation** junction carries its `relation`, because a `Derivation`
 *    HAS one. So `--relation=derivation` selects poster derivations on recorded
 *    metadata rather than dropping them as unaudited. Reporting a relation we
 *    hold would be the fabrication's mirror image: hiding evidence we have.
 *  - An **association** junction carries NO `relation`, because an
 *    `Association` makes no relation claim at all (`atlas/association.ts`). Any
 *    `--relation` filter therefore drops it into the legend's
 *    `droppedMissingMetadata` bucket — "nobody could put the question to it" —
 *    which is the correct reading, not an oversight.
 *  - NOTHING here carries a `beId`: the poster is not the bridge catalog. Every
 *    `--evidence` filter therefore drops the whole poster source as lacking
 *    metadata, and the legend says so out loud rather than rendering an empty
 *    map as an answer.
 *
 * Poster junctions never anchor a cluster: `componentsOf` keys `anchored` on
 * `'law' | 'established'` only. That is correct — the poster index is a map of
 * claims and their supports, not an assertion that any of them is textbook
 * physics — and it is recorded here because it is a decision, not an accident.
 *
 * Pure string/record production: no I/O, no registry reads beyond what the
 * caller passes in. Imports atlas LEAF modules only, never `atlas/index.ts`.
