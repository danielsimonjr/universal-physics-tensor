/**
 * Canonical-only graph — project the standard-physics L-layer
 * (`CANONICAL_EQUATIONS`) into the composition-graph edge vocabulary so the
 * discovery/analysis funnel (`upt discover` / `candidates` / `map`) can run on
 * established textbook physics ALONE, with the speculative 44-bridge catalog
 * excluded.
 *
 * WHY this exists: `CATALOG_GRAPH` mixes the 8 established bridges with 36
 * speculative ones, so a `promising` discovery there is polluted by
 * speculation. Feeding ONLY canonical equations gives (a) a new-candidate
 * review surface motivated by textbook physics, and (b) a regression harness —
 * discovery on canonical-only must introduce no numerical contradiction
 * (standard physics, fed to the inference suite, stays self-consistent).
 *
 * DESIGN — parity with the bridge graph:
 *   - Universal constants (G, c, ℏ, k_B, ε₀, σ_sb, b, e) are BAKED INTO the
 *     evaluator, exactly as the catalog edges bake them — they are not graph
 *     nodes. This keeps the candidate proposer about physical OBSERVABLES and
 *     lets the numeric filter fire from the standard `{ mass }` anchor (an
 *     anchor cannot supply G/c/ℏ). A `governing` entry is a constant iff its
 *     name is registered in `CANONICAL_CONSTANT_SI`; everything else is a
 *     physical variable and becomes a source/target node.
 *   - Every canonical equation is `established` physics, so every edge is
 *     `confidence: 'established'` — the canonical graph IS the anchored core.
 *   - `kind: 'law'` (within-domain ground truth, not a cross-regime bridge);
 *     `beId: null` (not a catalog bridge).
 *   - Evaluator: the dimensional MONOMIAL gives the power law over the variable
 *     sources, times the baked constant factor. The leading DIMENSIONLESS
 *     constant (2π, ¼, …) is not pinned by dimensions, so it is taken as 1 —
 *     values are correct up to an O(1) factor, which is all the same-dimension
 *     discovery surface needs. Where dimensions cannot pin a monomial
 *     (`monomial: null`, e.g. Newton's two same-dim masses), the edge carries a
 *     NaN evaluator; `retrodict` accepts only finite derivations, so it
 *     abstains cleanly rather than polluting the consistency check.
 *
 * The public counterpart to `CATALOG_GRAPH` (the 44-bridge graph): exported
 * from the package manifest and surfaced via the CLI's `--source=canonical`
 * flag on `discover` / `candidates` / `map`.
 *
 * @module composition/canonical-graph
