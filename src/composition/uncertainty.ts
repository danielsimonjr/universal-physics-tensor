/**
 * First-order uncertainty propagation through composition edges
 * (v0.10.0 T4 — fulfills the improvement plan's G-3 carrier claim:
 * "edges carry uncertainties, and uncertainty propagates through
 * composition").
 *
 *   σ_out² = Σᵢ (∂f/∂xᵢ · σᵢ)²        (independent-input Gaussian,
 *                                       first order)
 *
 * Partials are central differences with a relative step
 * h = 1e-6·max(|xᵢ|, 1e-30). Because composed edges ARE `BridgeEdge`s
 * (design D-2 closure), chains need no extra machinery — propagate on
 * the composed edge directly.
 *
 * Scope honesty: independent inputs only (no covariance matrix), first
 * order only (no curvature term). Adequate for the scalar closed-form
 * edges in the graph today; revisit both if correlated observables or
 * strongly nonlinear edges land.
