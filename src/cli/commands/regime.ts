/**
 * `upt regime` — where in parameter space a family's models are claimed to
 * apply, and where nothing is claimed at all.
 *
 * The whole point of this command is the TRI-STATE of `regimeHolds`. A model
 * whose regime could not be checked at the given point is reported as
 * UNKNOWN, never as valid and never as violated: `'unknown'` is a failure to
 * confirm validity, and folding it either way is the silent pass
 * `atlas/regime.ts` exists to prevent. The text and JSON forms therefore both
 * carry three buckets, not two.
 *
 * `--at` states the point. Values are π-group values keyed by
 * `PiGroup.formula` (or a dimensionless input's own name), so `--at
 * theta0=0.2` is a coordinate, not a parameter of the physics.
 *
 * The uncovered-region report is taken over the box the CALLER stated and no
 * other: `uncoveredRegions` refuses to synthesize an extent, so with no `--at`
 * there is no box and the command says so rather than inventing one.

        Where in parameter space a family's models are claimed to apply.
        --at states a point in REGIME COORDINATES (π-group formulas, or a
        dimensionless input's own name, e.g. --at theta0=0.2). Every model AND
        bridge is reported as valid, violated (naming the failed inequality),
        or UNKNOWN — a coordinate the point never supplied is NOT a pass, and a
        regime that states no inequality is marked VACUOUS rather than passed.
        A group can be given by its formula (spaces ignored, * read as ·, so
        --at "tau*D*q^2=1" works) or through its parameters: --at tau=1 D=1
        q=1 derives tau · D · q^2 = 1. A key that no record uses is named, and
        ignored.
        Also prints the pairwise overlap of the regimes and, over the box --at
        states, the points no CONSTRAINING regime covers.
        e.g.  upt regime oscillators --at theta0=0.2`;

/**
 * Collect `group=value` assignments from `--at` values and from bare
 * positionals, so `--at theta0=0.2 T0=1 t=10` works as written: the parser
 * gives `--at` one value and leaves the rest as positionals.
 *
 * @throws CliError on a malformed or non-finite assignment. A dropped
 *   coordinate would silently turn a CHECKED inequality into an unchecked one,
 *   which is exactly the reading this command exists to keep honest.
