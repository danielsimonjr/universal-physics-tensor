/**
 * `upt path` — the route between two models of a family, and what that route
 * actually WARRANTS.
 *
 * Two answers, kept apart on purpose, because `atlas/path-bound.ts` keeps them
 * apart: `findPath` says a chain of bridges exists, and that says nothing about
 * whether the chain supports a claim. `boundPath` says what it supports, and
 * its answer is a DISCRIMINATED UNION whose `'no-claim'` member carries no
 * number at all. This command never prints a bound for a no-claim, and never
 * synthesizes one — a precise-looking composed number over an undefined
 * composite is the most dangerous thing this tool could emit.
 *
 * A no-claim is an ANSWER, not an error: `upt path` exits 0 when the
 * composition table declines to compose. The refusal is the result.
 *
 * Horizons are evaluated only when `--at` supplies a `t`. An unevaluated
 * horizon is reported as unevaluated, on the same rule that makes
 * `regimeHolds` tri-state.
 *
 * The REGIME of every bridge on the path is checked at the `--at` point too.
 * A bound is claimed only inside its bridge's regime, so a horizon that holds
 * says nothing when the point is outside the regime: this command once printed
 * the pendulum bound and "all hold" at θ0 = 0.8, where the bound's own regime
 * is θ0 ≤ 0.5 and the true error is 2.6 times the bound. An unchecked regime
 * is reported as unknown, never as a pass.
