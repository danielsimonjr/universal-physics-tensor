 * Verb-first dispatcher for the UPT CLI — `upt <command> [args...]`.
 *
 * Owns: top-level `help`/`version` handling, the no-args demo, unknown-verb
 * exit-2 contract, and per-command dispatch (parse -> run -> map thrown
 * UsageError/CliError to the documented exit codes). Individual commands are
 * plain data (see `command.ts`) registered via `registerCommand`; this file
 * never special-cases a command by name, so later tasks add commands without
 * touching `runCli`'s body.
 *
 * `main.ts` is the one place that imports the real `cli-api.js` barrel and
 * wires `out`/`err`/`write` to real stdio — every `Command.run` receives
 * those as an injected `CommandCtx`, never reaching for `process.*` itself,
 * which is what makes commands testable in-process against `dist/cli/*.js`.

const HELP_TEXT = `upt — Universal Physics Tensor bridge-inference CLI

Usage:
  upt explain <quantity> [name=value | name] ...
        Explain how the graph determines a quantity: the identifiability
        verdict, recovered value, derivation chains, and whether the inputs
        are dimensionally sufficient.
        e.g.  upt explain hawking-temperature mass=1.989e30

  upt priority
        Triage the speculative bridges by structural DECIDABILITY against
        established physics (Tiers 1-3). NOT a credibility ranking.

  upt audit
        Try to derive every built-in bridge equation by dimensions: which
        re-derive as a recognized monomial (with the prefactor recovered),
        which are decoys, which are dimensionally open.

  upt map [--source=catalog|canonical|both] [--format=text|mermaid|dot|svg]
          [--proposed] [--out=PATH] [--equation "TARGET = EXPR"]
        Map how the equations LINK: connected components (clusters) of the
        graph by shared quantities, the anchored core, the link hubs, and
        the isolated tail.
        --format=mermaid|dot|svg emits the VISUAL map (quantities = nodes,
        equations = junctions colored by status, one subgraph per component).
        text (default) is the unchanged linkage printout. svg renders the dot
        layout via the optional @viz-js/viz peer (npm i @viz-js/viz; or pipe
        dot through "dot -Tsvg"). --proposed overlays the unadjudicated
        identity-consequence relations (gray dashed). --out writes to a file
        (default stdout).
        --equation "TARGET = EXPR" injects YOUR OWN equation as a violet 'user'
        node and reports where it lands (which cluster / shared quantities), with
        a "did you mean?" hint for names that miss the catalog vocabulary. Use
        underscores for multi-word quantities (photon_energy -> photon-energy).
        e.g.  upt map --equation "period = 2*pi*sqrt(length/gravity)"

  upt candidates [--source=catalog|canonical|both]
        Propose candidate cross-cluster links (quantities of the same
        dimension in different clusters) for PHYSICIST REVIEW — a
        coincidence-heavy surface, not discovered bridges.

  upt predict
        Project the catalog onto the (scale × force) regime plane and rank
        the EMPTY regime cells as undiscovered-connection hypotheses
        (triadic closure). Makes the namesake tensor operational. Review
        surface, not discovered bridges.

  upt discover [--source=catalog|canonical|both]
        VET the link candidates through the inference suite: hypothesise
        each identification a≡b and test whether it merges disconnected
        physics, unlocks quantities, and stays numerically consistent.
        Ranks promising / inert / contradictory.
        --source=canonical runs the funnel on the standard-physics L-layer
        ALONE (bridges excluded) — new candidates from established physics,
        and a self-consistency check (expect 0 contradictory).
        --derive emits, for each 'promising' identification, the ONE algebraic
        relation it implies (monomial elimination) as an UNADJUDICATED, math-only
        proposal — NOT a bridge (Part-VI §XXVII-B). Pairs with --source=canonical.
        --max-orders=N tunes the magnitude-clash threshold (default 3); looser N
        keeps more candidates 'promising', tighter N falsifies more as clashes.
        --anchor=k=v[,k2=v2] overrides the numeric anchor (default mass=M_sun)
        for the consistency/closure check. Both reshape the candidate pool that
        --derive consumes.

  upt connectors
        Of the 20 ISOLATED bridges, which could connect to the anchored
        core via a same-dimension identification? The structural frontier —
        same-kind connectors are the motivated set for physicist review.

  upt coverage
        Audit the catalog's empirical grounding — which bridges are
        data-confronted vs graph-computable vs encoded-only vs thin — to
        target the physicist review. Fabricates nothing.

  upt canonical
        List the canonical-equation registry — the standard-physics L-layer
        (textbook "answer key") with each entry's fidelity (L0/L1/L2),
        domain, and bridge partners, plus the coverage gap.

  upt recover
        Validate bridges against standard physics: classify each bridge↔
        canonical link as restates-canonical (F4 circularity — NOT a
        discovery), recovers (undeclared structural match), or
        dimensional-only.

  upt symbolic [--simplify]
        Compose bridges' SYMBOLIC (AST) forms, not just their numeric
        evaluators (the Observable contract). Shows the CT-1 / CT-1b chains
        composed by substitution, dimensionally validated and evaluable.
        With --simplify, folds the composed AST via MathTS (k_B cancels),
        re-validated dimensionally + numerically.

  upt eval "<formula>" name=value ...
        Evaluate YOUR OWN scalar formula (safe — arithmetic only). Knows
        pi/tau and sqrt/exp/ln/sin/...; any other name must be supplied.
        e.g.  upt eval "hbar*c^3/(8*pi*G*M*k_B)" hbar=1.054571817e-34 \\
                       c=299792458 G=6.6743e-11 M=1.989e30 k_B=1.380649e-23

  upt derive <target:dim> <var:dim> ... [--formula "<expr>"]
        Derive YOUR OWN equation's dimensional form. <dim> is a named
        dimension (length, time, mass, velocity, ...), a constant (hbar, c,
        G, k_B, e), or explicit (L^3.M^-1.T^-2). With --formula, also verify
        it and recover the dimensionless prefactor.
        e.g.  upt derive period:time length:length gravity:acceleration \\
                       --formula "2*pi*sqrt(length/gravity)"

  upt confront [--bridge=be-XX] [--rigor=stringent|moderate|loose] [--frontier]
               [--sensitivity]
        Run the catalog's committed real-data confrontations (predicted vs
        observed), each tagged with its RIGOR tier. --rigor filters to one tier
        (the precision core, or the loose tail that needs better data); --frontier
        ranks the σ-tests by margin to exclusion (tightest = most at-risk under new
        data); --sensitivity ranks the prediction's input elasticities.

  upt axes
        Axis-discrimination audit — which tensor classification axes GATE the
        discovery funnel (an axis gates only when it MEASURABLY fires). Reproduces
        the rank-7 result (topology/statistics/symmetry classify but do not gate).

  upt evaluate <be-NN> key=value ...
        Numerically evaluate a closed-form / spacetime bridge (BE-51/52/55..65).
        With no bridge id, lists the evaluable bridges and their input keys.
        e.g.  upt evaluate be-63 mu_e=2   → Chandrasekhar mass ~1.44 M_sun

  upt ground <quantityA> <quantityB>
        The epistemic-grounding ledger for one discovery candidate a=b: which
        falsifiers passed, which abstained (gaps), and the honest ceiling.

  upt help        Show this message.

Run with no arguments for a short demo.

  upt version     Show the installed CLI/package version.
  --json          Global flag: emit a machine-readable JSON envelope instead of
                  text (where the command supports it).`;
