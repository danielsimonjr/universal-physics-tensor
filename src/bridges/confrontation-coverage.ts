/**
 * Empirical-spine coverage audit (Direction 4).

 * "Strengthen the empirical spine" must NOT fabricate physics data, so the
 * responsible, composable deliverable is tooling that makes the spine's gaps
 * machine-visible: for each catalogued bridge, what grounding does it
 * actually have — a real-data confrontation, a computable graph edge, a
 * dimensional-signature encoding, or nothing but a status label? The report
 * tells the physicist-reviewer (CONTRIBUTING.md) exactly where the grounding
 * is thinnest, and lets the discovery loop prefer well-grounded bridges.
 *
 * This INVENTS nothing — every field is read from the catalog
 * (`BRIDGE_EQUATIONS`), the composition graph (`CATALOG_GRAPH`), and the two
 * committed data-confrontation modules.
 *
 * INTERNAL — surfaced via `upt coverage`.
