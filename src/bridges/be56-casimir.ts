/**
 * Bridge Equation 56 — Casimir effect (quantum vacuum ↔ classical force).
 *
 * Two neutral, parallel, perfectly-conducting plates in vacuum attract, because
 * the boundary conditions restrict the allowed electromagnetic vacuum modes
 * between them. The ideal zero-temperature force per unit area is
 *
 *     F/A = − π² ℏ c / (240 d⁴),
 *
 * (negative = attractive), d the plate separation. This bridges the QUANTUM
 * vacuum (zero-point field fluctuations) to a CLASSICAL, macroscopic, measurable
 * force. Predicted by Casimir 1948; measured by Lamoreaux 1997 and Mohideen &
 * Roy 1998 (see `be56-casimir-confrontation.ts`).
 *
 * Closed-form evaluator (BE-51/52 pattern; no AST round-trip). Dimensional
 * signature: pressure [L⁻¹ M T⁻²]. Note the REAL experiments use sphere-plate
 * geometry and require finite-conductivity/roughness/temperature corrections —
 * this ideal formula is the leading term, and the confrontation is honest about
 * the corrections (Adam/Eve vet 2026-07-05, Eve YELLOW: systematics-dominated).
