/**
 * Unified per-bridge descriptor — one lookup that JOINS the catalog's three
 * id-keyed registries so a consumer reads a single object instead of
 * cross-referencing three hand-maintained sources:
 *
 *   1. `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS`   — catalog metadata (status, refs, signature, …)
 *   2. `BRIDGE_RHS_BY_ID`   — faithful right-hand-side AST (where encoded)
 *   3. `CATALOG_GRAPH`      — composition-graph edge(s) keyed by `beId`
 *
 * This is a DERIVED facade, not a fourth source of truth: every field still
 * lives in its home registry. The point is anti-drift — the failure mode behind
 * the stale `DATA_CONFRONTED = {23,36}` set and the `6.075e-12` value was the
 * registries silently disagreeing. They are now (a) reachable through one
 * accessor and (b) cross-checked by one guard
 * (`tests/bridges/descriptor-consistency.test.ts`), so a future id that exists
 * in one registry but not another fails loudly instead of drifting.
