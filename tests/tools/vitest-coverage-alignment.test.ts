/**
 * The coverage provider must share vitest's major version (found 2026-09-25 while fixing the
 * persona pass).
 *
 * Dependabot #167 (2026-09-14) raised `@vitest/coverage-v8` to 5.0.0, whose peer dependency is
 * `vitest@5.0.0`, while vitest stayed on 4.1.11. Every coverage run then died with
 * "AssertionError: coverageFilesDirectory is required" and reported 0% on every file, so
 * `bun run test:probe-coverage` and `test:coverage` gated nothing. No CI job runs them, so nothing
 * turned red. This test fails whenever the two majors differ again.
