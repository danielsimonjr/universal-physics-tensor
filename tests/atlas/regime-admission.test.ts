/**
 * Sprint 2 — regime algebra, tri-state admission, and coverage gaps.
 *
 * Two rules from `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-2-Design.md` dominate this file,
 * and both are rules the design note CORRECTED after the Adam A2 vet:
 *
 *   §1 (RED #2) `regimeHolds` is TRI-STATE. An absent π-group value yields
 *   `'unknown'`, which is a failure to confirm validity and NEVER validity.
 *   The tests below assert `'unknown' !== true` explicitly, so the silent-pass
 *   defect cannot return by someone "simplifying" the type back to a boolean.
 *
 *   §0 (RED #1) A golden is a REGRESSION gate, not a correctness proof: it
 *   cannot see an error in a direction its inputs never travel. Correctness
 *   rests on PER-INEQUALITY boundary tests — just inside the bound, just
 *   outside it, and EXACTLY ON it. The on-the-bound case is the only one that
 *   separates `<` from `<=`, and no full-system test would reveal a swap.
