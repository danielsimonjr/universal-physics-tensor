/**
 * Atlas Phase 2 §S2.5 — the GR spine's regimes.
 *
 * Four claims are under test, and they are different claims:
 *
 *  1. **The numbers did not move.** The three `residualInSigma` values that
 *     `upt confront --json` prints for be-37/51/52 are pinned here to all
 *     printed digits. This pins the NUMBERS out of the JSON, not the bytes of
 *     the text report — `tests/cli/golden/confront.txt` pins the text, and the
 *     two must be able to fail independently. Adding a regime is a change of
 *     DESCRIPTION; if either moves, it was a change of physics.
 *  2. **Each bound is the geometry it claims to be.** Recomputed here from the
 *     defining quantities, so a bound cannot drift into something else while
 *     still reading as sourced. (An earlier revision of this file asserted the
 *     bound equalled `CASSINI.observed_gamma_sigma` — a measurement precision
 *     standing in for a field strength. It passed. That is why this test now
 *     checks the ARITHMETIC and not merely that some number was used.)
 *  3. **Each regime holds at its own confrontation's inputs** — and be-37 and
 *     be-51 report `'unknown'`, not `true`, once `v/c` is supplied, because
 *     neither claims anything about it.
 *  4. **Row and edge agree.**
 *
 * Plus the per-inequality boundary tests the design note (§0) requires: just
 * inside, exactly on, just outside. These carry most of the information here.
 * The bound IS the confrontation's operating point by construction, so claim 3
 * holds partly by construction; only the boundary tests can catch an `op`
 * confusion (`<` vs `<=`), which at these bounds is the difference between the
 * confrontation point being inside its own claim and outside it.
