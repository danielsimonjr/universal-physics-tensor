/**
 * Non-finite propagation through the connection-lowering kernels.
 *
 * PR #117 added early-bailout guards — `if (gInvAlphaRho !== 0)` in
 * computeChristoffelTensor and `if (gVal !== 0)` in contractChristoffelWithOperand.
 * Algebraically skipping a `0 * x` term is a no-op for finite `x`, but NOT when `x`
 * is NaN or ±Infinity: `0 * NaN === NaN` used to propagate and now never enters the
 * sum.
 *
 * How reachable that is differs per guard, and the answer is NOT the obvious one:
 *
 *  - computeChristoffelTensor: NARROW. A diagonal metric does NOT trigger it,
 *    because in Γ^α_μν = ½ g^{αρ}(∂_μ g_ρν + ∂_ν g_ρμ − ∂_ρ g_μν) the third term
 *    uses ρ as the DERIVATIVE index, so a NaN in derivs[k] is still weighted by
 *    g^{kk}. It takes a DEGENERATE inverse metric (a zero on the diagonal) — the
 *    numerical shape of a coordinate singularity, where this project does GL4
 *    stepping.
 *  - contractChristoffelWithOperand: COMMON. Any operand NaN sitting where a
 *    connection component is exactly 0 is dropped, and most Γ components vanish
 *    for symmetric metrics.
 *
 * The suppression is defensible: if Γ is exactly 0 the term's true contribution is
 * zero, and `0 * NaN = NaN` is an IEEE-754 artifact rather than the answer. What is
 * lost is a diagnostic alarm, not correctness.
 *
 * These tests pin the ACTUAL behaviour against ground truth (not self-consistency)
 * so the choice is explicit and any future change to it is deliberate.
