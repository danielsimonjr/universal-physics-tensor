/**
 * Atlas Phase 2 §0 — THE GR SPINE RE-EXPRESSION MUST CHANGE NO NUMBER.
 *
 * Sprint 2 re-expresses general-relativity validity conditions in dimensionless
 * form (`r_s/r`, `v/c`). That is a change of DESCRIPTION, not of physics, so
 * every confrontation number must be bit-identical before and after.
 *
 * ## Why this is a golden and not a re-reading
 *
 * This invariant is the one that can break SILENTLY. A subtly wrong
 * re-expression still returns plausible numbers, still passes a smoke test, and
 * is caught only by comparison against values captured BEFORE the change. A test
 * that recomputes both sides from the current tree would pass at every moment
 * and prove nothing — the same "check that cannot fail" shape that made a
 * catalog-wide evidence measurement vacuous in Sprint 1.
 *
 * So the expected values live in a COMMITTED artifact, captured at
 * 2026-09-21 07:40 on `8520228`, before any Sprint 2 edit existed.
 *
 * ## Zero tolerance, deliberately
 *
 * There is no `toBeCloseTo` here. The claim under test is "the description
 * changed and the physics did not"; ANY nonzero delta falsifies it. A tolerance
 * would let a real regression hide inside it, and would also quietly redefine
 * the claim into something weaker that nobody agreed to.
 *
 * ## Scope: numbers only
 *
 * Prose, citations and units are NOT pinned — they are expected to be edited,
 * and pinning them would make this test fail for reasons that have nothing to do
 * with the invariant, which is how a gate gets disabled.
 *
 * If this test fails during Sprint 2, the re-expression is wrong. Do NOT
 * regenerate the golden to make it pass: that discards the only evidence that
 * the physics was preserved.
