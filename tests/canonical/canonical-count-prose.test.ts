/**
 * The stated canonical-entry count must equal the REGISTRY, not a literal.
 *
 * Sprint 3 adds L1 entries, which moves this number. The Sprint 3 plan states that the count
 * "lives only in `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and the architecture docs" — three locations.
 * MEASURED 2026-09-22: the literal appears in **22 files**, and the live product docs the plan
 * did NOT name include `README.md`, `todo.md`, `docs/specification/Part-V.md` and three files
 * under `docs/research/`. So adding an entry would leave at least seven live prose statements
 * stale while every test still passed.
 *
 * THAT IS THE THIRD TIME IN THIS REPO that a number restated in several places was accompanied by
 * an INCOMPLETE list of the places — the CLI command count was in four locations, two of which
 * disagreed with each other by four (see `tests/cli/command-count-prose.test.ts`). The recurring
 * defect is not the stale number; it is trusting a hand-maintained list of where a number lives.
 *
 * So this test does not hardcode a list of files. It DISCOVERS every product doc stating the
 * count and asserts each against `CANONICAL_EQUATIONS.length`. A file added later is covered
 * without anyone remembering to add it here, which is the property the hand-maintained list
 * lacked.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covered: `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/architecture/archive/` are HISTORY. A release
 * note recording "103 canonical equations" at v0.40.0 stays true forever and must not be rewritten
 * when the registry grows. The same applies to dated audit findings under `docs/planning/`, which
 * record what was measured at the time.
