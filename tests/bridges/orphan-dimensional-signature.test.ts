/**
 * Catalog invariant: every entry whose `dimensional_signature` is non-null
 * must EITHER have a registered AST module (covered by the round-trip
 * test in `dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`) OR appear in the
 * `ORPHAN_DIMENSIONAL_SIGNATURES` allowlist below — and orphans must
 * actually have NO AST module.
 *
 * Why this exists (Wave G TA-F1, confidence 95): the round-trip catalog
 * test only iterates entries that *have* an AST module, so a typo or
 * accidental revert of an orphan signature string (BE-18, BE-29, BE-48
 * today) was silently uncovered. The `be-{18,29,48}-fix.test.ts` files
 * pin formula_latex / status but never read `dimensional_signature`.
 *
 * The test enforces the invariant in BOTH directions:
 *   1. Every id in the orphan allowlist has `dimensional_signature !== null`
 *      AND no AST module exists in `ENCODED_RHS_IDS`. ("Orphans really are
 *      orphans.")
 *   2. Every entry NOT in the allowlist that has `dimensional_signature !== null`
 *      MUST have an AST module. ("New encodings can't bypass round-trip
 *      coverage by accident.")
 *
 * As Tier-5 lands AST modules for BE-18 / BE-29 / BE-48, remove them
 * from `ORPHAN_DIMENSIONAL_SIGNATURES` and add them to `ENCODED_RHS_IDS`.
 *
 * Source: test-analyzer F1.
