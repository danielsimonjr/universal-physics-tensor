/**
 * `upt explain` says plainly when a name is not covered (persona finding C4, 2026-09-25).
 *
 * `upt explain qwertyuiop`, `upt explain soliton-speed` and `upt explain driven-damped-oscillator`
 * all printed "'X' cannot be determined from {} (no inputs): the graph has no derivation path" and
 * exited 0: the same answer as for a real quantity that the given inputs cannot reach. A name that is
 * not a quantity of the graph is now reported as NOT COVERED, with suggestions, and exits 1, as an
 * unknown model id does in `upt path`. A real quantity the inputs cannot reach is still an answer.
