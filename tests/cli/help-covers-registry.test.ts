/**
 * Every REGISTERED command is documented in `upt --help`.
 *
 * `--help` is a static text in `src/cli/main.ts`, not generated from the
 * registry. `command-count-prose.test.ts` counts commands by parsing that text,
 * so a command registered WITHOUT a help entry was runnable and invisible to it:
 * on 2026-09-22 `upt atlas` ran while `upt help` did not list it, and the count
 * gate could not have noticed. This test compares the registry itself against the
 * help text, which closes that gap.
