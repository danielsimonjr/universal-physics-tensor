/**
 * The stated command counts must equal the REGISTRY, not each other.
 *
 * This number is restated in prose in four places — `CLAUDE.md`'s architecture table and three
 * spots in `cli/README.md` — and nothing failed when one drifted. On 2026-09-22 all four were
 * stale AND TWO DISAGREED WITH EACH OTHER: the README said "19 commands" in one sentence and
 * "all 15 — every command in the tables above except `help` and `version`" in another, which are
 * two statements of the SAME quantity differing by four. Both had been wrong for long enough that
 * neither was obviously the newer.
 *
 * The repo's own rule is that a rule is enforced by something that FAILS or it is not enforced, so
 * the count now has a test. It asserts each prose figure against the LIVE registry rather than
 * against a hardcoded literal — a literal here would simply be a fifth place to rot.
