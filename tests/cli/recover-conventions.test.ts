/**
 * Atlas Phase 1 S1.4 — `upt recover`'s convention advisory.
 *
 * The load-bearing claim is that `upt recover` is UNCHANGED today. Proving an
 * absence needs a control, or a silent no-op would pass identically to a
 * working advisory that happens to find nothing. So this file asserts both
 * halves: the real registries produce no advisory, and a stubbed pair that
 * DOES disagree produces one. A gauge that cannot move is dead, not stable.
