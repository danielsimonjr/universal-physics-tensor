/**
 * Build the atlas benchmark item set with MODEL authors and MODEL raters.
 *
 * The owner removed the human bottleneck on 2026-09-22 ("use a fable model").
 * Every author, encoder and rater here is a model, and every artifact says so.
 * The resulting kappa is MODEL-rater agreement, not human inter-rater agreement.
 *
 * ## Independence is enforced by how each instance is launched
 *
 * Each role is a separate `claude -p` process. The launch gives it:
 * - no tools (`--tools ""`) and no MCP servers (`--strict-mcp-config`);
 * - no settings sources, no auto-memory and no session persistence;
 * - a working directory outside the repository (`F:/bench-iso`), so no
 *   CLAUDE.md is found;
 * - a replaced system prompt.
 *
 * Its only input is the prompt text below. The prompts contain no atlas source,
 * no atlas record and no description of how the atlas decides. The session that
 * wrote this script has read `src/atlas/`, so it authors, encodes and rates
 * NOTHING. It only runs the pipeline and assembles the files.
 *
 * Roles, each in its own instances:
 * 1. AUTHOR: writes items in prose and records the answer. It sees the domain
 *    names, the relation-type definitions and the failure-kind definitions.
 * 2. ENCODER: turns each item's public prose into the machine fields. It never
 *    sees the answer, the author's explanation or the source.
 * 3. RATER A and RATER B: separate instances with no shared context. Each sees
 *    only the public prose and returns valid/invalid plus a failure kind.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/atlas-benchmark-models.mjs <author|encode|rate|all>
 * Raw outputs go to tests/fixtures/atlas/benchmark/provenance/.

Domain: ${FAMILIES[family]}.
This is batch ${batch}; make the claims different from what an obvious first batch would contain.

The claimed relation is ONE of:
${RELATIONS}

Write exactly 8 VALID claims and exactly 8 INVALID claims.
Each invalid claim contains exactly ONE of these defects, and each defect is used exactly once:
${FAILURES}

Rules:
- Write each claim as a careful textbook would. State the assumptions, conditions, conventions or regime that the text itself relies on. In an invalid claim, the defect must be real but not announced.
- The wording must not reveal whether a claim is valid. Valid and invalid claims must look alike.
- The conclusion must contain exactly one equation, in plain text, for example "omega^2 = k/m".
- Base invalid claims on real textbook errata, known student misconceptions, or known subtle mistakes.
- Use SI units.

Reply with a JSON array of 16 objects, each with these keys:
"kind": "valid" or "invalid";
"failureKind": one of ${JSON.stringify(FAILURE_KINDS)} for an invalid claim, or null for a valid one;
"premises": array of strings;
"conclusion": string;
"claimedRelation": one of the relation names above;
"source": a short note on where the claim or the mistake comes from;
"explanation": one or two sentences on why the claim is valid, or what exactly the defect is.`;

"id": copied from the input.

"expr": the equation in the conclusion, written LHS = RHS, encoded as the expression tree for LHS - RHS.
Expression tree grammar (JSON):
- a quantity: {"kind":"symbol","name":"<name>","dim":{"L":a,"M":b,"T":c,"I":d,"Theta":e,"N":f,"J":g}}
  where the exponents are the quantity's SI dimension (length, mass, time, current, temperature, amount, luminous intensity).
- a number: {"kind":"symbol","name":"2","dim":{"L":0,"M":0,"T":0,"I":0,"Theta":0,"N":0,"J":0}}
- an operation: {"kind":"op","op":"*","args":[...]} with op one of "*", "/", "+", "-", "^". "^" takes [base, exponent].
- a function: {"kind":"transcendental","fn":"<fn>","arg":<tree>} with fn one of exp, ln, sin, cos, tan, sinh, cosh, tanh.
- a derivative d f / d x may be written as the quotient f / x for dimensional purposes.
Give each quantity the dimension the text gives it.

"sideConditions": array of the conditions the text states on quantities, for example "m > 0", "x ≠ 0", "|x| << 1". Write a non-vanishing condition as "<name> ≠ 0". Use [] when the text states none.

"conventions": include only if the text states a convention. An object with "premise" and/or "conclusion", each an object using only these keys and values:
"heatWorkSign": "Q-W" or "Q+W"; "metricSignature": "-+++" or "+---"; "fourierNormalization": "unitary", "physics" or "none"; "unitSystem": "SI", "gaussian" or "natural"; "capacitorChargeSign": "+" or "-".
Omit the key when the text states no convention.

"composedFrom": include only if the text says the conclusion is reached by chaining two relations. Then give the two relation names, in order, from: derivation, exact-equivalence, restriction, approximation, coarse-graining, analytic-continuation, structural-analogy, deformation-quantization. Otherwise omit the key.

"regime": include only if the text states a dimensionless condition AND the value it takes where the claim is used. Then give {"inequalities":[{"group":"<name>","op":"<" or "<=" or ">" or ">=","bound":<number>}],"values":{"<name>":<number>}}. Otherwise omit the key.
