# UPT Performance Benchmarks

This file records AD benchmark baselines established in v0.4.5. These are
baselines for regression detection starting in v0.5.0 — no threshold gates
exist in v0.4.5.

## Measurement notes

- Runner: `vitest bench` v4.1.4 (tinybench), Node 18+, Windows 11
- Machine: Daniel's dev box (platform-specific; not a cloud CI machine)
- Bench discipline: tensors pre-built outside the bench callback (F4 — measures
  AD cost only, not allocator/GC cost)
- `fromNested` is sync on `Float64ReferenceEngine`; no await overhead in setup
- `forwardGrad` / `reverseGrad` are async per v0.4.0 contract — Promise
  wrapper overhead is included in the measurement (no internal sync path
  is exposed on the public API)
- vitest 4.1.4 verbose reporter does not display per-bench hz tables for async
  bench callbacks (only the BENCH Summary with relative comparisons is shown).
  Absolute hz values are not captured in this baseline.
- MathTSEngine: optional dep (`@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor` +
  `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd`) not installed on this machine — skipped
  gracefully with `[bench/ad] MathTSEngine unavailable` warning.

## v0.4.5 AD baseline — `fn(x) = x*x`, Float64ReferenceEngine

Run date: 2026-05-17  
Function: element-wise self-multiplication (`engine.mul(t, t)`)  
Engine: `Float64ReferenceEngine` (always present)  
MathTSEngine: skipped (optional dep absent)

### Relative performance (from BENCH Summary, two representative runs)

| Shape | Elements | Forward mode | Reverse mode | Rev/Fwd speedup |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `[10]` | 10 | slower | faster | ~5x |
| `[100]` | 100 | slower | faster | ~70x |
| `[10, 10]` | 100 | slower | faster | ~70x |
| `[100, 100]` | 10 000 | slower | faster | ~8 000–14 000x |

**Interpretation:** Reverse-mode shows dramatically higher throughput than
forward-mode at large tensor sizes in `Float64ReferenceEngine`. This is
expected: the reverse-mode pass only traverses the tape once, while the
forward-mode dual-number path pays per-element tangent propagation cost on
every operation. At `[100, 100]` (10 000 elements), the per-element tangent
cost in forward mode dominates the async wrapper overhead, making the
reverse-mode speedup appear very large in the BENCH Summary ratios. These
ratios are not a tuning signal — both modes are naive O(n) implementations
and the ratios are a property of the dual-number vs. tape traversal costs at
this scale.

**Absolute hz values:** not captured in this baseline (vitest 4.1.4 async
bench limitation — see measurement notes above). The BENCH Summary provides
relative comparisons only. Absolute measurements can be captured by switching
to a sync bench wrapper or upgrading to a vitest version that reports async
bench hz tables.

### MathTSEngine

Not measured — optional dependency absent. The skip path prints:

```
[bench/ad] MathTSEngine unavailable — skipping MathTS AD benchmarks.
```

MathTS benches will appear in this table once the optional dep is installed.
