# UPT Specification — Revision History

Provenance ledger for the formal specification (`docs/specification/Part-*.md`).

The spec was hardened across a series of 2026-05 adversarial-review
iterations ("Waves" J, L, N, P, Q, R, S, U, Y, Z and their tiers, plus the
earlier R0/R1/R2/R3 audit loops). The per-note "Wave X Tier Y, per
Reviewer Z" attributions that used to live inline in the spec were
relocated here on 2026-06-10 so the spec documents read as clean
current-state references. **The spec files remain authoritative for
current content; this file records how that content was reached.** Where a
bridge equation was reformulated, the spec's Status line keeps the plain
`Reformulated YYYY-MM-DD` / `Corrected on YYYY-MM-DD` stamp; the wave/
reviewer detail is here.

Entries are grouped by spec part. Each line: `§section — Wave id(s)
date(s) — what changed`. Wave IDs and dates are copied verbatim from the
pre-condensation spec text.

## 2026-06-10 — wave-note relocation + structural additions

- Relocated all inline wave/reviewer provenance from Parts I–VI into this
  file (ledgers below). Net spec reduction ≈ 23 KB across the six core
  parts; no current-state content changed.
- Added **Part-X** (connection / curvature / field-equation layers) and
  `docs/specification/README.md` (spec index).
- Part-IV §10.2.1 Planck-length interferometry target formally
  reclassified long-term aspirational.
- Part-V §19.2 and Part-II §6.2.1: deleted the `[SUPERSEDED]` det(C)≠0 ∧
  λ_k≥0 consistency-requirement displays (the Harary 1953 balance-theoretic
  replacement is the live form).
- Catalog harmonized to 44 bridges (IDs 11–54) across all parts; BE-51–54
  formally catalogued in Part-II §V-B.

## Part-I — Theoretical foundation + BE-11–20

- §preamble (Framing commitment) — Wave J Tier A, 2026-05-05 — three fresh-eyes reviewers (Math M-C1, Phys C7, CS C2) flagged the catalog-vs-Hilbert-space framing incoherence; spec committed to the labeled multi-index catalog framing.

## 2026-06-11 (second pass) — essay relegation (G-4) + Part-IX Phase-B closure

- **G-4 executed:** Part-V §XXI (technology transfer/applications) +
  §XXII (risk assessment) and Part-VI §XXVIII–§XXX (advanced
  applications, emergency protocols, international governance)
  relocated verbatim to `docs/essays/` with heading-preserving stubs.
  Part-V 1208 → 1077 lines; Part-VI 770 → 299. §XXX-B
  (Status-Promotion Protocol) kept in core, renumbered §XXVII-B.
- **Part-IX:** C1/C4/C5 calibration rows marked REALIZED (CT-3, CT-1,
  CT-2+CT-4); the Phase-B positive-outcome bar (≥3 of C1–C5) recorded
  as MET 2026-06-11.

## 2026-06-14 — Part-IX §9 Phase-D candidate identifications

- **Part-IX §9 added:** three machine-proposed candidate quantity
  identifications (CI-1 correlation length, CI-2 critical timescale, CI-3
  information–cosmology energy) recorded as **PROPOSED, UNADJUDICATED**
  Phase-D hypothesis-generation output — surfaced by the linkage-map
  candidate generator (`proposeLinkCandidates`; 132 same-dimension pairs →
  3), none registered in `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS`, each pending physicist
  adjudication under the Status-Promotion Protocol (Part-VI §XXVII-B).
  Full analysis: `docs/research/Linkage-Candidate-Proposals.md`. README
  Part-IX status updated (Phases B–D met).

## Part XI — Proposed Equations (new, 2026-06-19)

- New non-normative supplement `Part-XI-Proposed-Equations.md`, indexed in the
  README. Catalogs the identity-consequence surfacer's machine-derived candidate
  relations (`upt discover --derive`; `deriveProposedBridges`/`toProposedEntry` in
  `src/composition/proposed-bridges.ts`) as **PROPOSED, UNADJUDICATED** output:
  PE-1 "Landauer photon" `ν = k_B ln2 T/h` and PE-2 dark-fermion/erasure
  temperature `T = v g/(k_B ln2)`. Held OUT of the 44-entry `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS`
  catalog; promotion requires the Status-Promotion Protocol (Part-VI §XXVII-B) via
  `promoteProposal`. Snapshot of 2 equations at `--source=both`; code + tests
  (`tests/composition/proposed-bridges.test.ts`) authoritative.
