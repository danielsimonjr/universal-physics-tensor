# Universal Physics Tensor Framework: Complete Formal Specification - Part II

> **Status note:** This document catalogs Bridge Equations 21-54 (BE-21–50 from the original spec catalog; BE-51–54 are post-original-spec catalog extensions documented in §V-B). Equations span a wide range of physical credibility: some (e.g., Eq 21 AdS/CMT; Eq 26 WKB tunneling; Eq 35 conformal bootstrap) are established results from mainstream physics; others (e.g., Eq 25 consciousness, Eq 42 firewall, Eq 46 multiverse, Eq 50 retrocausal QFT) are highly speculative. Each equation should carry a **Status** line indicating this; where one is missing, treat the equation as unvalidated. Several equations have known issues flagged in their Status notes (Eqs 22, 23, 24, 25, 31, 37, 38, 50). The mathematical formulations reproduced here are drawn from the literature (where cited) or are original proposals; formal citations are being retroactively added — see the Part-VI conclusion for the current citation-completeness status.

> **Spec-scope note (catalog count — added 2026-05-20; updated 2026-06-10).** The specification catalogs **44 bridge equations, IDs 11–54** (Part-I §II covers BE-11–BE-20; this Part-II covers BE-21–BE-54). The original spec catalog was 40 bridges (IDs 11–50); BE-51 (gravitational lensing — Eddington 1919 weak-field deflection) and BE-52 (Mercury perihelion precession — Einstein 1915) were added in v0.4.0 as GR-foundation bridges, and BE-53 (Yang-Mills one-loop β-function) and BE-54 (Randall-Sundrum brane cosmology) were added in the v0.7 BE-X re-encoding sprint. All four extensions are catalogued in §V-B below, matching the shipped codebase catalog (`src/bridges/index.ts`, `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS`, **44 entries, IDs 11–54**). Older wave-note prose elsewhere in the spec that says "40 bridges" / "IDs 11–50" refers to the original pre-v0.4.0 spec catalog. Status distribution across the 44-bridge catalog at HEAD: 8 established · 33 speculative · 3 highly-speculative · 0 invalid.

## V. Extended Catalog of Bridging Equations (21-54)

### Category F: Condensed Matter - High Energy Bridges

**Bridge Equation 21: AdS/CMT Correspondence Equation**

- **Status**: Established. The holographic dictionary for retarded Green's functions in AdS/CMT (anti-de Sitter / condensed matter correspondence) is a well-understood result (Son and Starinets 2002, *JHEP* 0209:042, arXiv:hep-th/0205051 — the canonical two-author paper; the formula below is the retarded-Green's-function recipe from that paper). The companion three-author paper (Policastro-Son-Starinets 2002, *JHEP* 0209:043, arXiv:hep-th/0205052) applies the recipe to AdS hydrodynamics. Earlier drafts of this entry attributed the recipe to "Son and Starinets 2002, arXiv:hep-th/0205052," which conflated the two papers — attribution updated 2026-05-05. **Venue regression fix 2026-05-05 (Wave J Tier C1):** the venue was previously stated as *Phys. Rev. D* 65:104021, which is incorrect; the arXiv hep-th/0205051 paper is published in *JHEP* 0209:042 (verified via arXiv abstract page). See also Iqbal and Liu 2009 (year corrected from 2008 in Wave J Tier C2: arXiv 0903.2596 is March 2009 and *Fortsch. Phys.* 57 is the 2009 volume). **Note:** the stated 'Dimensions: [G_R] = [T]' is incorrect; the dimension stated as `[L]^{2Δ−d}` in earlier drafts had a sign error and has been replaced 2026-05-05 (Wave I.B C2a) with the canonical momentum-space convention `[L]^{d−2Δ}`. Derivation: the boundary two-point function ⟨O(x)O(0)⟩_R of an operator of conformal dimension Δ scales as `|x|^{−2Δ}` (dim `[L]^{−2Δ}`), and Fourier-transforming with measure `dt d^{d−1}x` (dim `[L]^d`) gives `G_R(ω,k)` dim `[L]^{d−2Δ}`. The `r^{2Δ−d}` factor in the displayed formula is the bulk-radial scaling that exactly cancels the bulk-field's leading-mode `r^{−(d−Δ)}` to extract the boundary correlator's coefficient — that radial factor has dim `[L]^{2Δ−d}` but is *internal* to the limit; the *result* G_R(ω,k) has dim `[L]^{d−2Δ}`.
- **Context**: Holographic duality between strongly correlated electrons and gravitational systems
- **Linked Formulas**: AdS/CFT correspondence, Fermi liquid theory
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/G_R(%5Comega%2Ck)" alt="G_R(\omega,k)" /> is the retarded Green’s function of the boundary theory
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cphi(r%2C%5Comega%2Ck)" alt="\phi(r,\omega,k)" /> is the bulk field dual to the boundary operator
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5CDelta" alt="\Delta" /> is the conformal dimension of the boundary operator
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/d" alt="d" /> is the spatial dimension of the boundary

**Dimensions**: <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5BG_R%5D%20%3D%20%5BL%5D%5E%7Bd-2%5CDelta%7D" alt="[G_R] = [L]^(d - 2 Delta)" /> (depends on conformal dimension Δ and boundary dimension d). The earlier statement `[L]^{2Δ−d}` had a sign error: it gave the radial-factor exponent `r^{2Δ−d}` from the limit recipe, not the dimension of the *result* G_R(ω,k); replaced 2026-05-05 (Wave I.B C2a).

**Rationale**: Maps quantum critical phenomena in condensed matter to black hole horizon physics

**Bridge Equation 22: Topological Entanglement Entropy - Quantum Gravity Link**

> **AST encoding (Tier 5):** [`src/bridges/equations/be-22-topological-entanglement.ts`](../../src/bridges/equations/be-22-topological-entanglement.ts)

- **Status**: Speculative. **Reformulated 2026-05-05** to the canonical Kitaev-Preskill / Levin-Wen single-subsystem form (PRL 96:110404, 110405; 2006). The originally-stated three-term form `S_topo = -γ + α log(ξ/a) + β(T/T_c)^ν log(A_boundary/ℓ_P²)` had two unresolvable defects: (1) at finite temperature, topological order is destroyed (γ → 0 typically), making the `β(T/T_c)^ν` extension ill-defined as a TEE correction; (2) the `log(A_boundary/ℓ_P²)` factor reintroduces area-law scaling into a quantity that is, by construction, the area-law-*subtracted* constant part — those terms were not derivable from any standard TEE construction and have been removed. The Kitaev-Preskill formula itself is established in condensed-matter literature; the "QG link" framing — using TEE as a probe of gravitational entanglement — remains original to this catalog and is not in either Kitaev-Preskill or Levin-Wen, hence the preserved `speculative` status.
- **Context**: Connects topological phases to quantum error correction in gravity
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/S(R)%20%3D%20%5Calpha%20L(R)%20-%20%5Cgamma%20%2B%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(L%5E%7B-1%7D)" alt="S(R) = \alpha L(R) - \gamma + \mathcal{O}(L^{-1})" />

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/S(R)" alt="S(R)" /> is the von Neumann entanglement entropy of subsystem R (dimensionless, in nats)
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Calpha" alt="\alpha" /> is the non-universal area-law coefficient, dim [L<sup>-1</sup>]
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/L(R)" alt="L(R)" /> is the perimeter (boundary length) of subsystem R, dim [L]
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cgamma" alt="\gamma" /> is the topological entanglement entropy (dimensionless). For an abelian topological phase, γ = log D where D = √(Σᵢ d²ᵢ) is the total quantum dimension. For the Z₂ toric code, D = 2 → γ = log 2.
- The <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(L%5E%7B-1%7D)" alt="\mathcal{O}(L^{-1})" /> correction is a finite-size term, dropped in the AST encoding.

**Dimensions**: Entropy S(R) is dimensionless `[1]` (nats). The AST round-trips through `format(infer(RHS))` to the registered `dimensional_signature: '[1]'`.

**Bridge Equation 23: Strange Metal - Black Hole Duality (SYK Planckian dissipation)**

- **Status**: Speculative. **Dimensional fix 2026-05-06 (Wave Q A1, per Math iter-6 C1)**: added missing `m*` carrier effective mass factor in the numerator. The Wave P-C R-C1 form was missing the `m*` prefactor required by the canonical Drude+Planckian decomposition; SI dimensional analysis without `m*` yields `m³/(s·C²)` rather than the required `Ω·m = kg·m³/(s·C²)`. **Reformulated 2026-05-06** (Wave P-C R-C1, per Math/Researcher iter-5 strategic pivot — complete bridges to canonical literature forms when one exists, rather than preserving R3-invalid). Replaced the algebraically-vacuous `ρ(T) = ρ_0 + AT + B √(ℏ/(k_B T τ_P))` form (where the third term collapses to `B · 1` under the definitional identity `τ_P · k_B T = ℏ`) with the canonical SYK / Planckian-dissipation linear-in-T resistivity. The remaining `phenomenological-ansatz` known_issue is for the *bridge-equation framing* (using SYK Planckian dissipation as the condensed-matter ↔ holography duality), not for the linear-in-T phenomenology itself, which is empirically established (Bruin 2013 *Science* 339:804; Legros 2019 *Nature Phys.* 15:142). WebFetch on arXiv:1604.07818 (Maldacena-Stanford 2016) confirmed the abstract framing — emergent SL(2,R) conformal symmetry; the explicit Green's function form follows standard SYK textbook references.
- **Context**: Planckian dissipation in strange metals: linear-in-T resistivity from a SYK / holographic relaxation rate `ℏ/τ ~ k_B T` (Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev limit; Hartnoll-Hofman holographic strange-metal phenomenology).
- **Mathematical Formulation** (canonical Drude + SYK Planckian-dissipation form):

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Crho(T)%20%3D%20%5Crho_0%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7Bm%5E*%20k_B%20T%7D%7Bn_e%20e%5E2%20%5Chbar%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Calpha_%7B%5Ctext%7BSYK%7D%7D" alt="\rho(T) = \rho_0 + \frac{m^* k_B T}{n_e e^2 \hbar} \cdot \alpha_{\text{SYK}}" />

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Crho_0" alt="\rho_0" /> is the residual resistivity
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/m%5E*" alt="m^*" /> is the carrier effective mass (Drude prefactor; required for SI dimensional consistency `[ρ] = Ω·m`)
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/k_B%20T%2F%5Chbar" alt="k_B T/\hbar" /> is the Planckian relaxation rate (saturating the Maldacena–Shenker–Stanford chaos bound `λ_L ≤ 2π k_B T / ℏ`)
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/n_e" alt="n_e" /> is the carrier density and `e` the electric charge
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Calpha_%7B%5Ctext%7BSYK%7D%7D" alt="\alpha_{\text{SYK}}" /> is a SYK-model dimensionless coefficient (~ O(1)) depending on the chosen SYK-q variant; for q=4 the conformal two-point function is `G(τ) ∝ |τ|^{-1/2}`

This form (i) recovers the empirical linear-in-T strange-metal resistivity, (ii) commits to a specific microscopic origin (SYK Schwinger-Dyson at strong coupling) consistent with the Hartnoll-Hofman 2010 holographic momentum-relaxed strange-metal model (arXiv:0912.0008), and (iii) connects to black-hole physics via Maldacena-Stanford's emergent near-extremal-AdS₂ dual.

### Category G: Quantum Biology Bridges

**Bridge Equation 24: Quantum Coherence in Photosynthesis Efficiency (Förster FRET)**

- **Status**: Speculative. **Reformulated 2026-05-06** (Wave P-C R-C2, per Math/Researcher iter-5 strategic pivot — complete bridges to canonical literature forms when one exists, rather than preserving R3-invalid). Replaced the bound-violating multiplicative `η_classical(1 + κ exp(-t/τ_coh) |⟨ψ_d|ψ_a⟩|²)` form (admits `η > 1` for `κ ∈ [0.1, 0.3]` and `η_classical ≈ 1`) with the canonical Förster (1948) FRET dipole-dipole rate `k_FRET = (1/τ_D)(R_0/R)⁶` and the bound-respecting transfer efficiency `η = R_0⁶/(R_0⁶ + R⁶) = 1/(1 + (R/R_0)⁶) ∈ [0,1]` by construction. The remaining `phenomenological-ansatz` known_issue is for the *bridge-equation framing* — interpreting FRET in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes (FMO, LH2, LHCII) as a UPT quantum ↔ biological bridge — not for the FRET formulas themselves which are textbook-canonical (Lakowicz 2006). FRET is incoherent: it does not encode "quantum-coherent enhancement," and the contested-coherence question (Cao 2020 *Sci. Adv.* 6:eaaz4888 / Duan 2017 *PNAS* 114:8493 / Thyrhaug 2018 *Nat. Chem.* 10:780) is documented in the references list. WebFetch on the Wikipedia FRET article confirmed `k_ET = (R_0/r)⁶/τ_D`, `R_0⁶ ∝ κ² Q_D J / n⁴`, and `E = 1/(1 + (r/R_0)⁶)`.
- **Context**: Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET): dipole-dipole transfer rate and transfer efficiency for donor-acceptor pairs separated by distance `R`, with Förster radius `R_0` (typically 2-10 nm) at which `η = 1/2`.
- **Mathematical Formulation** (canonical Förster FRET):

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Ceta_%7B%5Ctext%7Btransfer%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BR_0%5E6%7D%7BR_0%5E6%20%2B%20R%5E6%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%20%2B%20(R%2FR_0)%5E6%7D" alt="\eta_{\text{transfer}} = \frac{R_0^6}{R_0^6 + R^6} = \frac{1}{1 + (R/R_0)^6}" />

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/k_%7B%5Ctext%7BFRET%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau_D%7D%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7BR_0%7D%7BR%7D%5Cright)%5E6" alt="k_{\text{FRET}} = \frac{1}{\tau_D} \left(\frac{R_0}{R}\right)^6" />

where:

- `R` is the donor-acceptor distance
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/R_0" alt="R_0" /> is the Förster radius (typically 2-10 nm; the distance at which `η = 0.5`)
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Ctau_D" alt="\tau_D" /> is the donor radiative lifetime in the absence of the acceptor
- The Förster radius is set by `R_0⁶ ∝ κ² Q_D J / n⁴`, with `κ²` the dipole orientation factor, `Q_D` the donor quantum yield, `J` the spectral overlap integral, and `n` the medium refractive index

**Dimensions**: Dimensionless `η ∈ [0,1]`; `k_FRET` has units of `[time^-1]`.

**Bridge Equation 25: Consciousness - Information Integration Bridge (IIT Φ)**

> **AST encoding (Tier 5):** [`src/bridges/equations/be-25-iit-phi.ts`](../../src/bridges/equations/be-25-iit-phi.ts) — the **live** BE-25 encoding (the IIT Φ_max form; `dimensional_signature: '[1]'`, since Φ is dimensionless / measured in bits when log₂ is used). The earlier module [`src/bridges/equations/be-25-orch-or.ts`](../../src/bridges/equations/be-25-orch-or.ts) is **archived** (Wave Q B2, 2026-05-06): it encodes the dropped Penrose-Hameroff `t_OR` form, is no longer load-bearing for any BE-25 dimensional claim under the Wave P-D R-D2 IIT Φ_max reformulation, and is preserved only with an archive banner for historical traceability. The archived module has been removed from `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` and from the round-trip catalog test. (Note: Φ_max is exponential in system size, so the encoding is tractable only for small substrates — see the **Tractability** note below.)

- **Status**: Speculative (IIT canonical and calculable; bridge framing speculative). **Reformulated 2026-05-06** (Wave P-D R-D2, per Math iter-5 / Researcher iter-5 strategic pivot — complete bridges to canonical literature forms when one exists, rather than preserving R3-invalid). Replaced the Tegmark-falsified Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR form `t_OR = ℏ/(Δm c² Δx/ℓ_P)` — which combined a non-Penrose `Δx/ℓ_P` factor (Penrose's canonical gravitational self-energy is `E_G ~ G(Δm)²/Δx`) with a microtubule-coherence mechanism that Tegmark (*Phys. Rev. E* 61, 4194 (2000); arXiv:quant-ph/9907009) falsified by ~10 orders of magnitude (decoherence ~10⁻¹³ s vs. neural processing ~10⁻³ s at biological temperature) — with the canonical **Integrated Information Theory (Tononi) Φ_max** form: irreducibility of a system's cause-effect structure under the minimum information partition (MIP), with intrinsic information `ii(s,s̃) = p(s̃|s) log₂[p(s̃|s)/p(s̃)]`. The "consciousness ↔ *quantum* information" framing is dropped in favor of "consciousness ↔ information integration": IIT is substrate-agnostic, calculable for small systems (Oizumi-Albantakis-Tononi 2014, IIT 3.0; Albantakis et al. 2023, IIT 4.0, arXiv:2212.14787 — WebFetch-confirmed abstract), and consistent with the Tegmark-decoherence rebuttal (no claim about microtubule quantum coherence). WebFetch on Wikipedia "Phi (integrated information theory)" / "Integrated information theory" confirmed the canonical Φ-via-MIP formula and the intrinsic-information form. **Important — downstream excisions retained:** Part-IV §12.3, Part-V §21.2.2, and Part-VI §28.2 were excised in Wave L Tier B3 because BE-25 was Penrose-Hameroff. Those excisions are **not restored** under this IIT reformulation: the original sections were tied to the Penrose-Hameroff cosmic-consciousness / clinical-applications framings, and IIT-based clinical applications (e.g., perturbational complexity index PCI in disorders of consciousness — Casali et al. 2013 *Sci. Transl. Med.* 5:198ra105) are an active research area outside UPT's current scope. See `tests/bridges/be-25-reformulation.test.ts` for the reformulation pin.
- **Context**: Integrated Information Theory (IIT, Tononi) Φ_max — substrate-agnostic measure of integrated information. Consistent with the Tegmark-decoherence rebuttal of Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR (IIT makes no claim about quantum coherence).

- **Mathematical Formulation** (canonical IIT minimum-information-partition form):

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5CPhi_%7B%5Cmax%7D(S)%20%3D%20%5Cmin_%7B%5Ctheta%20%5Cin%20%5Ctext%7Bpartitions%7D(S)%7D%20%5Cleft%5B%20ii(s%2C%20%5Ctilde%7Bs%7D)%20-%20ii_%7B%5Ctheta%7D(s%2C%20%5Ctilde%7Bs%7D)%20%5Cright%5D" alt="\Phi_{\max}(S) = \min_{\theta \in \text{partitions}(S)} \left[ ii(s, \tilde{s}) - ii_{\theta}(s, \tilde{s}) \right]" />

with the intrinsic-information component

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/ii(s%2C%20%5Ctilde%7Bs%7D)%20%3D%20p(%5Ctilde%7Bs%7D%20%5Cmid%20s)%20%5Clog_2%20%5Cfrac%7Bp(%5Ctilde%7Bs%7D%20%5Cmid%20s)%7D%7Bp(%5Ctilde%7Bs%7D)%7D" alt="ii(s, \tilde{s}) = p(\tilde{s} \mid s) \log_2 \frac{p(\tilde{s} \mid s)}{p(\tilde{s})}" />

where:

- `S` is a candidate substrate (a system of mechanism-elements with cause-effect structure)
- `s` is the system's current state; `s̃` ranges over candidate cause/effect states
- `θ` ranges over bipartitions of `S` (the minimum information partition / MIP is the partition that minimally reduces intrinsic information)
- `ii(s, s̃)` is the intrinsic information — how much the system's state constrains potential cause/effect states (relative to the unconstrained marginal)
- `Φ_max(S)` is the system's integrated information; in IIT, a system has phenomenal experience iff `Φ_max > 0`
- IIT 3.0 (Oizumi-Albantakis-Tononi 2014) computes Φ via earth-mover's distance / Wasserstein metric over partitions; IIT 4.0 (Albantakis et al. 2023) is the current canonical formulation with explicit axiom-postulate framework

**Tractability**: `numerical-asymptotic` — Φ_max computation is exponential in the number of elements (EXPTIME; intractable beyond ~10 elements but computable / Turing-decidable for any finite substrate; **Wave Q B1 / CS iter-6 C1** corrected the prior `formally-divergent` label, which miscategorized Φ_max as non-Turing-computable). Approximate measures (Φ*, Φ^G, geometric Φ) exist for larger systems but each gives different numbers and is not interchangeable with Φ_max.

**Contested-framework note**: Tononi's identification of phenomenal consciousness with maximally-integrated information is a **postulate**, contested by Aaronson 2014 (computational counterexamples yielding arbitrarily large Φ for systems generally not regarded as conscious) and Doerig et al. 2019 *Conscious Cogn.* 72:49 (unfolding argument). The phenomenological-ansatz known_issue is for the *bridge framing* (using Φ_max as the canonical UPT consciousness ↔ information bridge), not for the IIT framework itself which is canonical.

**Bridge Equation 26: DNA Mutation - Quantum Tunneling Rate**

> **AST encoding (Tier 5):** [`src/bridges/equations/be-26-dna-tunneling.ts`](../../src/bridges/equations/be-26-dna-tunneling.ts)

- **Status**: **Speculative** (WKB formula canonical, biological-relevance bridge framing speculative; **status downgraded Wave S 2026-05-06 per Phys iter-7 IMPORTANT** — the prior 'established' label was inconsistent with the predictive gap below). The WKB tunneling rate formula itself is standard quantum mechanics (Gamow 1928; Landau-Lifshitz QM Section 50) and remains canonical literature. The application to DNA base-pair tautomerization via proton tunneling is a real research area (Loewdin 1963) with ongoing debate about biological relevance. **Known issue (registered 2026-05-05, Wave I.B C6, per Evo Biologist IMP-1 + IMP-2 paper review):** the bare WKB rate `Γ_WKB` with reasonable barrier parameters overshoots observed mutation rates (~10⁻⁸-10⁻¹⁰ /bp/replication) by 2-4 orders of magnitude; the `f(T, pH, EM)` prefactor silently absorbs the dominant biological-mechanism corrections — polymerase proofreading (~10⁻⁵) and mismatch repair (MMR, ~10²) — without which the formula is not predictive of biological mutation rates. A defensible BE-26 must either (a) factor `f = f_proofreading × f_repair × f_environment` explicitly, or (b) replace tunneling-as-mutation-mechanism with the mainstream replication-error / polymerase-fidelity model. **The status downgrade reflects the bridge framing's speculative element** — the WKB formula stands; the claim that DNA mutations are dominantly tunneling-driven does not, as written.
- **Context**: Proton tunneling in base pair tautomerization
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5CGamma_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmutation%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Cnu_0%20%5Cexp%5Cleft(-%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Chbar%7D%5Cint_%7Bx_1%7D%5E%7Bx_2%7D%5Csqrt%7B2m(V(x)-E)%7D%20%2C%20dx%5Cright)%20%5Ccdot%20f(T%2C%5Ctext%7BpH%7D%2C%20%5Ctext%7BEM%7D)" alt="\Gamma_{\text{mutation}} = \nu_0 \exp\left(-\frac{2}{\hbar}\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\sqrt{2m(V(x)-E)} \, dx\right) \cdot f(T,\text{pH}, \text{EM})" />

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cnu_0%20%5Csim%2010%5E%7B13%7D" alt="\nu_0 \sim 10^{13}" /> Hz is the attempt frequency

### Category H: Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics

**Bridge Equation 27: Fluctuation-Dissipation Violation in Active Matter**

- **Status**: Speculative extension. Frequency-dependent effective temperature is a standard concept in active-matter / non-equilibrium statistical mechanics (Cugliandolo 2011, J. Phys. A 44:483001). The specific functional form used here is phenomenological. **Prefactor verification (Wave N-completion Tier E2, 2026-05-06, per Phys iter-4 MINOR):** the classical FDT (Kubo 1966, Rep. Prog.

Rev. 83:34) relates the response function χ(ω) to a correlation via the canonical form `χ''(ω) = (1/2k_B T) · S_FF(ω)` (Kubo) or equivalently `χ(ω) = (1/k_B T) · ∫dt e^{iωt} d/dt⟨δx(t)δx(0)⟩` (Callen-Welton form). The form displayed below uses the `1/(k_B T_eff(ω))` prefactor outside an integral over `⟨δF(t)δx(0)⟩` — a non-standard cross-correlator; standard FDT uses either the auto-correlator `⟨δx(t)δx(0)⟩` (Callen-Welton) or `⟨δF(t)δF(0)⟩` (force-noise form). Treat the displayed integral as schematic; for any operational use, replace with the canonical `χ''(ω) = (1/2k_B T_eff(ω)) S(ω)` plus the active-matter `Σ_active` correction.

**Bridge Equation 28: Maximum Entropy Production Principle**

- **Status**: Contested principle. Maximum Entropy Production (MEPP) is a proposed but contested principle in non-equilibrium thermodynamics (Dewar 2005; rebutted by Grinstein and Linsker 2007). It conflicts with Prigogine's minimum entropy production for near-equilibrium linear systems. Treat as speculative.

**Bridge Equation 29: Jarzynski Equality Extension to Gravity**

- **Status**: Speculative extension. The Jarzynski equality for free-energy differences from non-equilibrium work (Jarzynski 1997, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78:2690) is established in flat-spacetime statistical mechanics. The curved-spacetime extension proposed here, where the gravitational work is the matter-action variation under metric perturbation, is novel to this framework and requires independent derivation.

> **Corrected on 2026-05-01 (R1 audit):** Replaced the ill-defined `dT^{μν}` (a rank-2 tensor differential with no specified integration manifold) with the canonical Hilbert action variation `T^{μν} δg_{μν} √(-g) d⁴x`. This is the standard expression for the matter-action change under a metric variation in general relativity (Misner-Thorne-Wheeler *Gravitation* §21.3 Eq. 21.51; Wald *General Relativity* (1984) §E.1 Eq. E.1.14, defining `T^{μν} := (2/√(-g)) δ(√(-g) L_matter)/δg_{μν}`, whence `δS_matter = (1/2) ∫ T^{μν} δg_{μν} √(-g) d⁴x` in geometric units; the `1/c⁴` factor restores SI dimensions of action). The factor `1/2` (vs. the original `1/1`) follows directly from the standard definition of `T^{μν}` via metric variation. The covariant volume element `√(-g) d⁴x` is required for diffeomorphism invariance. Status remains *speculative* — the *form* of the gravitational work is now standard GR, but applying Jarzynski's flat-spacetime equality to this curved-spacetime work is the conjectural extension and is unverified.

### Category I: Emergent Spacetime

**Bridge Equation 30: Entanglement - Geometry Equation (FLM first-law / linear-response)**

- **Status**: **Speculative (canonical formula, speculative QG-emergence framing). Reformulated 2026-05-06 (Wave P-A R-A1, per Math iter-5 / Researcher iter-5 strategic pivot — complete bridges to canonical literature forms when one exists, rather than preserving R3-invalid).** The previous form `g_{μν}(x) = η_{μν} + κ Σ_{ij} ⟨x|Tr_j(ρ_{ij} log ρ_{ij})|x⟩` was structurally ill-formed (rank-2 LHS vs scalar RHS, non-normalizable `|x⟩`, dimensionally wrong κ); replaced with the canonical **first-law-of-entanglement / FLM linear-response form**: `δS_EE(R) = ⟨δH_R⟩` where H_R is the modular Hamiltonian of the reduced density matrix on region R. Reference verified via WebFetch on Blanco-Casini-Hung-Myers 2013 (arXiv:1305.3182) which states the form explicitly: "ΔS = ΔH for the first order variation of the entanglement entropy ΔS and the expectation value of the modular Hamiltonian ΔH". FLM 2013 (arXiv:1307.2892) uses this as the linear-response input to bulk one-loop corrections in AdS/CFT. The framework keeps `speculative` (not `established`) because the linear-response identity is canonical only inside its derivation domain (AdS/CFT, ball-shaped regions in conformally-flat space, etc.); the *use* of this identity as the basis for ER=EPR-style entanglement-geometry equivalence outside the strict AdS/CFT regime — which is the framing UPT proposes — remains conjectural. The phenomenological-ansatz tag is for the framing extension, not the linear-response math itself. See `tests/bridges/be-30-reformulation.test.ts` for the reformulation pin.

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cdelta%20S_%7B%5Ctext%7BEE%7D%7D(R)" alt="\delta S_{\text{EE}}(R)" /> is the variation of entanglement entropy on region R under a small perturbation of the state
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/H_R%20%3D%20-%5Clog%20%5Crho_R" alt="H_R = -\log \rho_R" /> is the modular Hamiltonian of the reduced density matrix `ρ_R = Tr_{R̄} ρ` (trace over the complement region)

- The canonical (Blanco-Casini-Hung-Myers 2013, arXiv:1305.3182; FLM 2013, arXiv:1307.2892) regime is AdS/CFT with ball-shaped regions in conformally-flat backgrounds, where `H_R` admits a closed expression as an integral of `T^{tt}` over R weighted by a known boost generator; UPT extending the linear-response identity to non-AdS / non-holographic settings is the speculative element.

**Bridge Equation 31: Causal Set - Continuum Limit**

- **Status**: Speculative. Benincasa-Dowker (arXiv:1001.2725) established discrete-to-continuum limits for causal set action and Ricci scalar. **Reformulated 2026-05-05** (Wave I.B C3, per Mathematician M-I + Physicist I9 paper review): replaced the originally-stated `R = (2/√π)(N/V^{2/4} - k_1 - k_2(ρ²ℓ_P⁴)^{1/4})` form — which contained both a `V^{2/4}→V^{1/2}` typo and a dimensional mismatch in the `(ρ²ℓ_P⁴)^{1/4}` term against Ricci-scalar dimensions `[L^{-2}]` — with the canonical Benincasa-Dowker d=4 inclusion-exclusion formula. The earlier `R2 gap-spec` block proposed a `/⟨n(p)⟩`-divided variant which is incorrect; the published Benincasa-Dowker (2010 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 104:181301) form is additive (no sprinkling-density division). Status remains *speculative* because (a) the d≠4 generalization requires re-deriving coefficients and (b) using BD's discrete Ricci scalar as a *bridge equation* between causal-set discreteness and continuum spacetime — i.e., committing to causal-set dynamics as UPT's microstructure — is original to this catalog and is not in BD itself.

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cell_P" alt="\ell_P" /> is the Planck length; the prefactor `4/√6` is the d=4 dimension-specific coefficient (different in d=2)
- The d=2 form has different coefficients; numerical convergence studied in Glaser-Surya 2014 *Class. Quantum Grav.* 31:045007

The original form (preserved here as historical record):

contained the `V^{2/4}→V^{1/2}` typo and the dimensionally-mismatched `(ρ²ℓ_P⁴)^{1/4}` term, and was not derivable from any standard causal-set-theory construction.

**Bridge Equation 32: Quantum Reference Frame Transformation**

- **Status**: Active research. Quantum Reference Frames (QRF) formalism -- where reference frames are themselves quantum systems that can be in superposition -- is a legitimate active research area (Giacomini, Castro-Ruiz and Brukner, *Nat. Commun.* 10, 494 (2019), arXiv:1712.07207; de la Hamette and Galley, arXiv:2004.14292). The transformation formula captures the essential structure: changing reference frame integrates over group elements weighted by a unitary representation, tensored with the frame's quantum state. The formalism is well-defined but currently lacks direct experimental verification. (Previous draft had a misattributed Status note referring to causal-set quantum gravity -- that was a copy-paste error and has been corrected here.)

### Category J: Phase Transitions and Criticality

**Bridge Equation 33: Quantum-Classical Critical Point Mapping (Hertz-Millis canonical scaling, 3D Heisenberg)**

- **Status**: **Speculative (canonical scaling form, framework-pin to 3D Heisenberg). Corrected on 2026-05-20 (commit `394d164`, bridge physics audit):** the finite-T correlation-length exponent was changed from `−ν/z` (pinned −0.71) to `−1/z` (pinned −1 for z=1). At a quantum critical point `ξ ~ T^{−1/z}`: z alone sets the temperature dependence; ν governs the separate T=0 tuning-parameter axis. Literature anchor: `cond-mat/0503298` states `ξ ~ (T/Tc)^{−1/z}` explicitly. The mathematical formulation below reflects the corrected form. **Reformulated 2026-05-06 (Wave P-A R-A2, per Math iter-5 / Researcher iter-5 strategic pivot — complete bridges to canonical literature forms when one exists, rather than preserving R3-invalid).** The previous ansatz `ξ_quantum(T) = ξ_classical / √(1 + (E_0/k_B T)²)` was broken (gave the wrong T → 0 limit ξ → 0 instead of the required QCP divergence; missing dynamic exponent z). Replaced with the canonical **Hertz-Millis scaling form** (Hertz 1976 *Phys. Rev. B* 14:1165; Millis 1993 *Phys. Rev. B* 48:7183; Sondhi-Girvin-Carini-Shahar 1997 *Rev. Mod. Phys.* 69:315; Sachdev 2011 *Quantum Phase Transitions* 2nd ed., Ch. 11), pinned to **3D Heisenberg universality class (z = 1)** as the canonical reference case. The `ν` parameter remains in the AST node interface for API stability but the corrected scaling no longer depends on it. See `tests/bridges/be-33-reformulation.test.ts` for the reformulation pin.

> **AST encoding (Tier 5):** [`src/bridges/equations/be-34-kibble-zurek.ts`](../../src/bridges/equations/be-34-kibble-zurek.ts)

- **Status**: Established extension. The Kibble-Zurek defect density n ~ (tau_Q/tau_0)^(-d nu / (1 + z nu)) is established (Kibble 1976; Zurek 1985). The added exp(-m_defect c^2 / (k_B T_reh)) suppression for curved spacetime / reheating is a phenomenological extension not derived from the cited mechanism. **Temperature-scale issue:** the relevant temperature for defect-formation Boltzmann suppression is the symmetry-breaking / critical temperature T_c at the phase transition, not the (typically higher) reheating temperature T_reh. Using T_reh would weaken the suppression relative to the correct T_c scale. **Dimensional fix completed (Wave L Tier I4, 2026-05-05, per Phys I6 iter-3):** the displayed formula now includes the explicit `1/a^d` prefactor (previously only documented in the Part-I §A glossary entry for `a` while the formula remained dimensionally inconsistent). With `1/a^d` in front, the LHS dimensions `[L]^(-d)` are recovered.

**Bridge Equation 35: Conformal Bootstrap - Physical Operator Equation**

- **Status**: Established. The conformal bootstrap crossing-symmetry equation is well established in CFT and has produced rigorous bounds on critical exponents for the 3D Ising model and other theories (Rattazzi-Rychkov-Tonni-Vichi 2008, arXiv:0807.0004; Poland-Rychkov-Vichi 2018 review arXiv:1805.04405).

### Category K: Modified Theories and Extensions

**Bridge Equation 36: MOND / TeVeS — GW170817 graviton-speed bound**

> **AST encoding (Tier 5):** [`src/bridges/equations/be-36-gw-speed-bound.ts`](../../src/bridges/equations/be-36-gw-speed-bound.ts)

- **Status**: Speculative. **Reformulated 2026-05-06** (Wave P-C R-C3) from the bespoke hybrid linear blend `F = F_N μ(a/a_0) + F_DM (1 − μ(a/a_0))` (not in any published MOND literature) to the canonical Bekenstein 2004 TeVeS (Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity) framing, and then **AST-encoded 2026-05-07 (Wave Y)** to the operationally-checkable **GW170817 graviton-speed bound** `|c_GW − c|/c ≤ 10⁻¹⁵`. The TeVeS action `S = S_g + S_φ + S_A + S_matter` (three dynamical fields — metric, scalar, timelike vector) is operator-valued and admits no clean scalar AST encoding without committing to a specific bulk geometry; the dimensionless GW170817 ratio is the AST-encodable scalar that the bridge now carries. TeVeS is preserved as the *bridge framing* (see "Framing context" below). The relationship to BE-38 is preserved: BE-38 (Wave I.B C4 reformulation) covers the non-relativistic Milgrom `μ(x) = x/√(1+x²)` form; BE-36 covers the relativistic-completion framing — different physical content, complementary not duplicative.
- **Context**: GW170817 graviton-speed bound — the 2017 binary-neutron-star merger detection (Abbott et al. 2017 *ApJ Lett.* 848:L13; ~1.7 s gravitational-wave / gamma-ray arrival difference over ~40 Mpc) constrains the graviton propagation speed to `|c_GW − c|/c ≲ 10⁻¹⁵`. This strongly constrains TeVeS-class theories, which generically predict `c_GW ≠ c` from the timelike-vector field's contribution to the dispersion relation.
- **Mathematical Formulation** (GW170817 graviton-speed bound):

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cfrac%7B%7Cc_%7B%5Ctext%7BGW%7D%7D%20-%20c%7C%7D%7Bc%7D%20%5Cleq%2010%5E%7B-15%7D" alt="\frac{|c_{\text{GW}} - c|}{c} \leq 10^{-15}" />

where:

- `c_GW` is the gravitational-wave propagation speed and `c` the speed of light
- The encoded scalar is the signed dimensionless ratio `(c_GW − c)/c`; the absolute-value bound is exposed via the `satisfiesGW170817Bound` numerical helper. `dimensional_signature: '[1]'`.

> **Framing context — Bekenstein 2004 TeVeS (the relativistic MOND completion).** BE-36's bridge framing is the canonical relativistic completion of MOND: the TeVeS action `S = S_g + S_φ + S_A + S_matter` (Bekenstein 2004 *Phys. Rev. D* 70:083509, arXiv:astro-ph/0403694), where `S_g` is the Einstein-Hilbert action for the metric `g_μν`, `S_φ` is the scalar-field action with the MOND interpolation function `μ̃(y)` (`y = ℓ²(g^μν − A^μ A^ν) φ_,μ φ_,ν`), `S_A` is the timelike-vector-field action with a Lagrange multiplier enforcing `A^μ A_μ = -1`, and `S_matter` couples through the physical metric `ĝ_μν = e^{-2φ} g_μν − 2 sinh(2φ) A_μ A_ν`. The non-relativistic weak-field limit recovers the canonical MOND interpolation `F_eff = F_N · μ̃⁻¹(F_N/(F_N + a_0))`, which reduces to standard MOND (BE-38: Milgrom `μ(x) = x/√(1+x²)`) for `a ≪ a_0 ≈ 1.2×10⁻¹⁰ m/s²`. Original TeVeS variants are strongly constrained or ruled out by the GW170817 bound encoded above (Boran et al. 2018 *Phys. Rev. D* 97:041501, arXiv:1710.06168); only carefully-tuned subclasses or successor RMT theories (Skordis-Złośnik 2021 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 127:161302, arXiv:2007.00082) survive — which is precisely why the GW170817 ratio, not the TeVeS action, is the operative encoded bridge.

**Bridge Equation 37: Modified light-propagation — Shapiro gravitational time delay**

> **AST encoding (Tier 5):** [`src/bridges/equations/be-37-shapiro-delay.ts`](../../src/bridges/equations/be-37-shapiro-delay.ts)

- **Status**: **Speculative** (Shapiro delay canonical and experimentally confirmed; bridge framing speculative). **Reformulated 2026-05-11 (Wave Z-F, per OpenAI o3 consultation — analogous to the Wave P-D R-D2 BE-25 and Wave Z-E BE-16 reformulations).** The previous BE-37 was the variable-speed-of-light (VSL) ansatz `c(t) = c_0[1 + ε(t/t_P)^n exp(-t/t_c)]`, dispositioned **R3-invalid** in the R3 audit (2026-05-05) because it fails the Ellis-Uzan 2005 operational-meaningfulness critique (only dimensionless ratios of constants are measurable; a bare `c(t)` is a relabeling of the unit system over time, not physics) and is not derived from any of the three non-equivalent canonical VSL formulations (Albrecht-Magueijo 1999, Moffat 1993, Barrow 1999). The Wave Z-F move is **not** to pick one of those three (each fails Ellis-Uzan independently) but to replace VSL entirely with the canonical operationally-meaningful **Shapiro gravitational time delay** — the standard general-relativistic "effective-c" effect that *does* survive Ellis-Uzan. Status is `speculative` (not `established`) because Shapiro delay itself is canonical and Cassini-confirmed, but the *bridge framing* — treating Shapiro delay as the UPT "modified-light-propagation" bridge — is the speculative element.
- **Context**: Shapiro gravitational time delay — coordinate-time delay of light passing near a massive body. The canonical operationally-meaningful "effective-c" effect that survives the Ellis-Uzan 2005 critique of vacuum `c(t,x)`-variation. (Light always travels at `c` locally; the delay arises from integrated path-length / coordinate-time effects in curved spacetime — it is NOT a "varying c" in any fundamental sense.)
- **Mathematical Formulation** (canonical Shapiro 1964 gravitational time delay):

where:

- `M` is the mass of the deflecting body
- `R_far`, `R_near` are the radial distances bounding the light path past the body (`R_far ≥ R_near`)
- The prefactor `2GM/c³` has dimension `[time]` (the light-travel-time scale of the Schwarzschild radius); the log argument `R_far/R_near` is dimensionless. The encoded form uses the GR-canonical PPN parameter `γ = 1` (coefficient `2GM/c³`); a more general PPN encoding would use `(1+γ)GM/c³`.

> **Historical record — the R3-invalid VSL ansatz, superseded 2026-05-11:** the previous BE-37 was the variable-speed-of-light ansatz `c(t) = c_0[1 + ε(t/t_P)^n exp(-t/t_c)]` with the associated modified Friedmann equation `H² = (8πG/3)ρ + (ċ/c)H + (1/2)(ċ/c)²`. It was dispositioned R3-invalid (2026-05-05) — see [`docs/planning/BE-37-VSL-Disposition-Brief.md`](../planning/BE-37-VSL-Disposition-Brief.md) for the full disposition analysis — and is preserved in commit history. The Wave Z-F reformulation replaces it with the Shapiro-delay form above; the Albrecht-Magueijo / Moffat / Barrow VSL proposals are retained in the catalog's `references[]` as historical context only.

**Bridge Equation 38: Entropic Gravity Correction Term**

- **Status**: Speculative. Based on Verlinde (arXiv:1001.0785). Contested; not accepted as mainstream physics. **Reformulated 2026-05-05** (Wave I.B C4, per Physicist I12 paper review): replaced the originally-stated `F = F_N[1 + α√(a₀/a) tanh(√(a/a₀))]` interpolation — which fails the deep-MOND limit (the `a → 0` limit yields `F → F_N(1+α) ~` Newtonian rather than the required `F → √(F_N a₀)`) — with the canonical Milgrom 1983 MOND interpolation `μ(x) = x/√(1+x²)`, where `x = a/a₀`. This recovers Newtonian scaling for `a >> a₀` and deep-MOND scaling `F → √(F_N a₀)` for `a << a₀` by construction. The Verlinde 2017 mass-correction variant (*SciPost Phys.* 2:016; arXiv:1611.02269; SciPost year corrected from 2016 to 2017 in Wave L Tier H2 per Researcher iter-3) and TeVeS relativistic completion (Bekenstein 2004 *Phys. Rev. D* 70:083509) are documented in `references[]` for future work but are non-equivalent reformulation paths. The remaining `phenomenological-ansatz` known_issue is for the *bridge-equation framing* (using MOND as the Newtonian-dark-sector link), not for the interpolation function itself which is canonical.

> **Wave U 2026-05-06 (Tier-5 AST encoding)**: BE-38 reformulated from the implicit form `F = F_N · μ⁻¹(a/a_0)` with `μ(x) = x/√(1+x²)` (Wave I.B C4) to the equivalent explicit ν-form `F = F_N · ν(z)` with `z = F_N/(m a_0)` and `ν(z) = √[(1+√(1+4/z²))/2]`. The two forms are mathematically equivalent (Famaey-McGaugh 2012 *Living Rev. Relativity* 15:10); the explicit ν-form is directly computable in closed form and avoids the implicit `μ⁻¹` lookup. Limits: `z → ∞` (Newtonian) gives `ν → 1, F → F_N`; `z → 0` (deep-MOND) gives `ν → √(2/z), F → √(m · F_N · a_0)`. AST module: `src/bridges/equations/be-38-mond.ts`. Encoding test bracket-checks: Newtonian limit, deep-MOND limit, golden-ratio identity at `z = 1` (`F = F_N · √φ ≈ 1.272 F_N`), and direct cross-derivation against the implicit μ-relation `μ(a/a_0)·a = a_N` to machine precision.

failed the deep-MOND limit (in the `a → 0` limit `√(a₀/a) → ∞` and `tanh(√(a/a₀)) ≈ √(a/a₀)`, so the bracket → `1 + α`, giving `F → F_N(1+α)` ~ Newtonian rather than the required `F → √(F_N a₀)`).

### Category L: Quantum Field Theory Extensions

**Bridge Equation 39: Asymptotic Safety in Quantum Gravity**

- **Status**: Speculative (active research). Asymptotic safety (Weinberg 1979; Reuter 1998 *Phys. Rev. D* 57:971, arXiv:hep-th/9605030) is an active research program proposing a UV-finite gravity. The functional renormalization group flow equation as written is at the schematic level; specific truncation choices (Einstein-Hilbert, f(R), etc.) are required for computation. Not yet experimentally confirmed. **Sign-convention note (Wave N-completion Tier E3, 2026-05-06, per Phys iter-4 MINOR):** the displayed `+A g²` term in `β_g` follows the convention where `A > 0` is required for the non-Gaussian UV fixed point at `g_* > 0` to attract the flow from below — i.e., for the canonical Reuter (1998) Einstein-Hilbert truncation, scheme conventions yield `A > 0`. The "−Cg²λ" minus is conventional given the sign of the Λ-coupling cross-term in the Wetterich equation (Reuter-Weyer 2009 *Gen. Rel. Grav.* 41:983 fix the explicit values). Different sign conventions in the literature (including Codello-Percacci-Rahmede 2009) absorb factors of 2π or `1/(16π)` differently; the schematic form here is convention-light. For any operational use, fix the convention by reference to a specific truncation paper.

\end{align}" />

> **Wave S 2026-05-06 (per Math iter-7 IMP-6):** the `-Fg²` term in `β_λ` was missing in earlier drafts and is added here. In the canonical Reuter (1998) Einstein-Hilbert truncation the `g²` coupling in the cosmological-constant flow is required to fix the non-Gaussian fixed point's `λ_*` value (without it, `λ_*` cannot be determined from `g_*` alone). `F` is a separate scheme-dependent coefficient — the symbol differs from `B` in `β_g` to avoid confusion. See Reuter-Weyer 2009 *Gen. Rel. Grav.* 41:983 for the canonical EH-truncation values.

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/g%20%3D%20G(k)k%5E2" alt="g = G(k)k^2" /> is the dimensionless Newton coupling

Replaced f² with f⁴. **Author-attribution correction 2026-05-06 (Wave N Tier A5, per Researcher iter-4 C1):** earlier draft mis-attributed arXiv:hep-ph/0703164 to "Contino-Grojean-Moretti-Piccinini-Rattazzi 2007"; the canonical author list is **Giudice-Grojean-Pomarol-Rattazzi 2007** (verified against arXiv abstract and JHEP record).

**Bridge Equation 42: Firewall Complement Principle**

- **Status**: Highly speculative. Firewall paradox is unresolved. The specific "complement principle" formulation here is not a standard result; the decomposition |psi> = a|smooth> + b|firewall> is a tautological superposition without physics content unless f(observer, protocol) is independently specified.

**Bridge Equation 43: ER=EPR Wormhole-Entropy Bound**

- **Status**: **Speculative (canonical Bekenstein-Hawking bound, ER=EPR framing remains conjectural). Reformulated 2026-05-06 (Wave P-A R-A3, per Math iter-5 / Researcher iter-5 strategic pivot — complete bridges to canonical literature forms when one exists, rather than preserving R3-invalid).** The previous form `dℓ_wormhole/dt = -γ S_entanglement + δ ∫ T_μν u^μ u^ν dV` was structurally malformed (sign-backwards from the standard ER=EPR heuristic; entropy + stress-energy-integral cannot combine into length/time without unphysical coefficient roles for γ and δ). Replaced with the canonical **ER=EPR wormhole-entropy-bound form**: `S_entanglement ~ A_wormhole / (4 ℓ_P²)` — the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound (Bekenstein 1973 *Phys. Rev. D* 7:2333; Hawking 1975 *Commun. Math. Phys.* 43:199) applied to the minimal cross-section of an Einstein-Rosen bridge. WebFetch on Maldacena-Susskind 2013 (arXiv:1306.0533) returned the abstract confirming the canonical ER=EPR equivalence statement: "two distant black holes are connected through the interior via a wormhole, or Einstein-Rosen bridge...interpreted as maximally entangled states of two black holes that form a complex EPR pair." Stanford-Susskind 2014 *Phys. Rev. D* 90:126007 (arXiv:1406.2678, "Complexity and Shock Wave Geometries") develops complexity-volume duality on top; the companion Susskind-Zhao 2014 paper (arXiv:1408.2823, "Switchbacks and the Bridge to Nowhere") extends to switchback geometries. Citation disambiguated Wave R 2026-05-06 per Researcher iter-7 C2 — earlier drafts conflated the two arXiv IDs. Status remains `speculative` because the ER=EPR conjecture itself remains conjectural outside the strict eternal-black-hole / thermofield-double AdS/CFT regime; the bound formula is canonical Bekenstein-Hawking, the framing is the speculative element. **Honest-claude flag:** WebFetch returned abstract only, not the precise formula derivation; `S ~ A/(4ℓ_P²)` is canonical Bekenstein-Hawking applied to the ER bridge's minimal cross-section, but the precise ER=EPR-paper equation was not WebFetch-confirmed in this commit. See `tests/bridges/be-43-reformulation.test.ts` for the reformulation pin.

Soft-hair-on-black-holes proposals (Hawking-Perry-Strominger 2016, arXiv:1601.00921) suggest that BMS supertranslation charges can store information that would otherwise be lost.

**Bridge Equation 45: Trans-Planckian Censorship Constraint**

- **Status**: Speculative / non-standard. The Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (Bedroya-Vafa 2019, arXiv:1909.11063) bounds inflationary e-foldings via `N_e < ln(M_P / H_inf)`. The formula as written here adds an extra term `-gamma log(r / 0.01)` with no derivation; this extension is original to this framework and has no published reference. Additionally, the log base is unspecified — TCC uses natural logarithm (ln), not log base 10. Revisions should cite arXiv:1909.11063 and either remove the extra term or derive it.

> **Correction (Round 6):** The term `-γ log(r/0.01)` is an **extension original to this framework**, not part of the Bedroya-Vafa TCC (arXiv:1909.11063). The standard TCC bound is `N_e < ln(M_P / H_inf)` (natural log). The `log` above should be read as `ln` unless otherwise specified.

**Bridge Equation 46: Multiverse Measure Problem**

- **Status**: Highly speculative. The multiverse measure problem is an unsolved fundamental issue in cosmology. Specific measure proposals are untestable without further theoretical development.
- **Context**: Probability distribution over universes

> **AST encoding (Tier 5):** [`src/bridges/equations/be-47-bbn-dark-sector.ts`](../../src/bridges/equations/be-47-bbn-dark-sector.ts)

- **Status**: Speculative extension on top of an established base. Standard BBN Boltzmann rate equations are well-established (Wagoner, Fowler & Hoyle 1967, ApJ 148:3 (foundational BBN); Wagoner 1969, ApJS 18:247 (BBN network update); Kawano 1992 code; Pitrou-Coc-Uzan-Vangioni 2018 review, Phys. Rep. 754:1). The dark-sector coupling term `⟨σv⟩_dark n_χ² ε_transfer` is a novel extension for light-element abundance modification by dark matter interactions (cf. Pospelov 2008; Boehm-Dolan-McCabe 2013).
- **Context**: Dark matter effects on light element abundances
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cfrac%7BdY%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%2B%203HY%20%3D%20%5Clangle%5Csigma%20v%5Crangle_%7B%5Ctext%7BSM%7D%7D%20n_p%20n_n%20-%20%5Clangle%5Csigma%20v%5Crangle_%7B%5Ctext%7Bdark%7D%7D%20n_%5Cchi%5E2%20%5Cepsilon_%7B%5Ctext%7Btransfer%7D%7D" alt="\frac{dY}{dt} + 3HY = \langle\sigma v\rangle_{\text{SM}} n_p n_n - \langle\sigma v\rangle_{\text{dark}} n_\chi^2 \epsilon_{\text{transfer}}" />

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/H" alt="H" /> is the Hubble expansion rate
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/n_p%2C%20n_n" alt="n_p, n_n" /> are proton and neutron number densities (the example two-body process is p + n → d + γ; for other reactions the appropriate unlike-species product applies)

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cepsilon_%7B%5Ctext%7Btransfer%7D%7D" alt="\epsilon_{\text{transfer}}" /> is the energy transfer efficiency between sectors

> **Corrected on 2026-05-01 (R1 audit):** Added the Hubble dilution drag term `+3HY` to the LHS — every species-abundance Boltzmann equation in an FRW background carries this term to account for the comoving-vs-physical-density distinction; without it the equation describes flat spacetime, not cosmology (Kolb & Turner *The Early Universe* (1990) §5.2 Eq. 5.13–5.14; Pitrou-Coc-Uzan-Vangioni 2018, Phys. Rep. 754:1, Eq. 2.5). Replaced `n_b²` with `n_p n_n` for the SM-channel two-body reaction — `⟨σv⟩` between distinct species multiplies the *product* `n_p n_n`, not a single-species square; the `n_b²` form is only appropriate when both reactants are the same species (Kolb & Turner §5.2; Steigman 2007 Annu. Rev. Nucl. Part. Sci. 57:463, Eq. 27 for the standard p+n→d+γ rate). Status downgraded `Established base equation with speculative extension` → `Speculative extension` for consistency: the *base* form is now correct and corresponds to the canonical reduced BBN equation, but the dark-sector coupling term remains the unverified physics extension. See also Pitrou-Coc-Uzan-Vangioni 2018 Eq. 2.5 for the full BBN network template.

### Category O: Quantum Foundations

**Bridge Equation 48: Objective Collapse Equation (GRW extension)**

- **Status**: Established (within GRW class). Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber-Pearle spontaneous collapse models (Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber 1986, Phys. Rev. D 34:470; CSL: Pearle 1989, Ghirardi-Pearle-Rimini 1990) propose modifications to the Schroedinger equation. **Note on rate:** the canonical GRW rate is `lambda ~ 1e-16 s^-1`; the value `1e-17 s^-1` previously written here corresponds to a specific CSL-variant bound. Current experimental bounds on the CSL collapse rate span roughly 1e-17 to 1e-8 s^-1 depending on coupling assumptions (see Bassi-Ghirardi 2003 review, Phys. Rep. 379:257, arXiv:quant-ph/0302164; Bassi et al. 2013 Rev. Mod. Phys. 85:471). The `sigma ~ 1e-7 m` localization length matches standard GRW.
- **Context**: Spontaneous wavefunction collapse
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

> **Corrected on 2026-05-04 (R0 audit):** Added the missing `(πσ²)^{-3/4}` prefactor to `L_x`. The 3D Gaussian-resolved position projector requires this normalization to ensure `∫ d³x L_x† L_x = 1` (i.e. the localization-amplitude squared integrates to a dimensionless probability), which is the trace-preservation / probability-conservation condition for the GRW master equation; without it the d³x integral injects an unabsorbed `[L^3]` factor and the equation does not close dimensionally — `dρ/dt` would not have units of `[T^-1]` as required. Citation: Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber 1986, Phys. Rev. D 34:470 (original); Bassi-Ghirardi 2003, Phys. Rep. 379:257 (review, arXiv:quant-ph/0302164). The 1D analogue carries `(πσ²)^{-1/4}`; the cube-root power tracks the dimensionality of the position eigenspace. Status remains **Established** — this is a typesetting / transcription correction to a canonical formula, not a reformulation. Also rate updated `lambda ~ 1e-17 → 1e-16 s^-1` to match canonical GRW (the 1e-17 figure refers to a specific CSL bound and was unsourced here).

**Bridge Equation 49: Quantum Darwinism Redundancy**

- **Status**: Speculative extension. Quantum Darwinism (Zurek 2009, Nat. Phys. 5:181) is established as an interpretational framework. The specific algebraic decay form `I(S:F_k) = I(S:E) − O(k^{-α})` is a phenomenological ansatz not derived from the Zurek formalism; the exponent α is a free parameter.
- **Context**: Classical reality from quantum substrate
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

**Bridge Equation 50: Retrocausal QFT (Wheeler-Feynman half-retarded-plus-half-advanced)**

- **Status**: **Highly speculative (canonical Wheeler-Feynman form, untested absorber boundary condition in QFT). Reformulated 2026-05-06 (Wave P-A R-A4, per Math iter-5 / Researcher iter-5 strategic pivot — complete bridges to canonical literature forms when one exists, rather than preserving R3-invalid).** The previous form `S = ∫d⁴x [L_forward(φ_+) + L_backward(φ_-) + λφ_+ φ_- δ⁴(x − x_m)]` was variationally ill-posed at the δ⁴ single-point interaction (δ-function source terms in equations of motion are not finite-action solutions; boundary conditions for the backward-evolving sector were unspecified). Replaced with the canonical **Wheeler-Feynman 1945 absorber-theory form**: the gauge field expressed as the half-retarded-plus-half-advanced symmetric sum `A_μ(x) = (1/2)[A_μ^ret(x) + A_μ^adv(x)]`; the action is then standard Maxwell + matter + interaction with this gauge-field expression. Reference verified canonical via WebFetch on the Wheeler-Feynman_absorber_theory Wikipedia article: "the resulting field is E_tot(x,t) = Σ_n [E_n^ret(x,t) + E_n^adv(x,t)]/2" (gauge-field analogue is the A_μ form above). The retrocausal claim is that the **absorber boundary condition** — every emitted radiation is absorbed somewhere in the universe — makes the half-retarded-plus-half-advanced symmetric form physically equivalent to standard retarded-only Maxwell, per Wheeler & Feynman's original argument. Status remains `highly-speculative` because the absorber boundary condition is empirically untested in QFT (works in classical electrodynamics under cosmological total absorption, but its quantum-field-theoretic extension is conjectural). Cramer 1986 *Rev. Mod. Phys.* 58:647 transactional interpretation is the canonical modern lineage; it remains a minority interpretation. The W-F form itself is rigorously defined, hence the reformulation lifts BE-50 from R3-invalid to highly-speculative. See `tests/bridges/be-50-reformulation.test.ts` for the reformulation pin.

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/A_%5Cmu%5E%7B%5Ctext%7Bret%7D%7D" alt="A_\mu^{\text{ret}}" /> is the retarded solution to the Maxwell equations (sources in the past light-cone)
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/A_%5Cmu%5E%7B%5Ctext%7Badv%7D%7D" alt="A_\mu^{\text{adv}}" /> is the advanced solution to the Maxwell equations (sources in the future light-cone)
- The full action is then standard Maxwell + matter + interaction with this gauge-field expression: `S_total = ∫(L_matter + L_interaction) d⁴x`, with `L_interaction = j^μ A_μ` using the half-retarded-plus-half-advanced `A_μ` above
- The absorber boundary condition (every emitted radiation is absorbed somewhere) makes this physically equivalent to standard retarded-only Maxwell in classical electrodynamics; the QFT extension that UPT proposes (per Cramer 1986 transactional interpretation lineage) is the highly-speculative element

## V-B. Post-Original-Spec Catalog Extensions (BE-51–54)

> **Provenance.** BE-51/52 were added in v0.4.0 as GR-foundation bridges (closed-form evaluators with geodesic cross-validation); BE-53/54 were added in the v0.7 BE-X re-encoding sprint (structural AST encodings via `BetaFunctionNode` and `FriedmannEquationNode`). This section was added 2026-06-10 to bring the formal spec catalog into one-to-one correspondence with the shipped codebase catalog (`src/bridges/index.ts`). Entries follow the §V house format; the codebase entry remains authoritative for `notes` / `known_issues` drift.

**Bridge Equation 51: Gravitational Lensing — Eddington 1919 weak-field deflection** *(Category I: Emergent Spacetime)*

> **Evaluator:** [`src/bridges/gravitational-lensing.ts`](../../src/bridges/gravitational-lensing.ts) (`evaluateGravitationalLensing`)

- **Status**: Established. Deflection of light by a point mass under the weak-field (post-Newtonian) approximation. Eddington's 1919 eclipse expedition confirmed GR's prediction of ~1.75 arcsec for a grazing solar ray — double the Newtonian value — to within the measurement precision of the time (Dyson, Eddington & Davidson 1920 *Phil. Trans. R. Soc.* A 220:291; Einstein 1915 *Preuss. Akad. Wiss.* 844; Carroll 2004 *Spacetime and Geometry* §8.5; Will 2014 *Living Rev. Relativity* 17:4, arXiv:1403.7377).
- **Context**: Bridges Newtonian gravity ↔ general relativity; first observational confirmation of spacetime curvature by mass
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Calpha%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B4%20G%20M%7D%7Bb%20c%5E2%7D" alt="\alpha = \frac{4 G M}{b c^2}" />

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Calpha" alt="\alpha" /> is the deflection angle (radians)
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/M" alt="M" /> is the deflecting point mass, <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/b" alt="b" /> the impact parameter
- Domain: `b > 0`; weak-field regime `b ≫ r_s = 2GM/c²`

**Dimensions**: `[α] = [1]` (dimensionless — `GM/(bc²)` cancels exactly). Solar grazing validation: α ≈ 8.49×10⁻⁶ rad ≈ 1.75 arcsec; geodesic cross-validation (null RK4, 200k steps) passes to ±1e-4 relative error.

**Rationale**: The factor-of-2 excess over the Newtonian half-deflection is the cleanest closed-form discriminator between curved-spacetime and flat-space-plus-force descriptions of gravity.

**Bridge Equation 52: Mercury Perihelion Precession — Einstein 1915 closed-form** *(Category I: Emergent Spacetime)*

> **Evaluator:** [`src/bridges/perihelion-precession.ts`](../../src/bridges/perihelion-precession.ts) (`evaluatePerihelionPrecession`)

- **Status**: Established. GR prediction of anomalous perihelion advance per orbit. Einstein's 1915 calculation reproduced Mercury's observed ~43 arcsec/century excess precession (beyond Newtonian + planetary perturbations) — the first successful quantitative GR test, predating the 1919 eclipse expedition (Einstein 1915 *Preuss. Akad. Wiss.* 831; Le Verrier 1859; Carroll 2004 *Spacetime and Geometry* §7.4; Will 2014 *Living Rev. Relativity* 17:4, arXiv:1403.7377).
- **Context**: Bridges Newtonian gravity ↔ general relativity; bound-orbit (timelike geodesic) counterpart to BE-51's null-geodesic test
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5CDelta%5Cvarphi%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B6%5Cpi%20G%20M%7D%7Ba(1-e%5E2)c%5E2%7D" alt="\Delta\varphi = \frac{6\pi G M}{a(1-e^2)c^2}" />

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5CDelta%5Cvarphi" alt="\Delta\varphi" /> is the perihelion advance per orbit (radians)
- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/a" alt="a" /> is the semi-major axis, <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/e" alt="e" /> the eccentricity
- Domain: `0 ≤ e < 1`, `a > 0` (bound elliptical orbits only)

**Dimensions**: `[Δφ] = [1]` (dimensionless — `GM/(ac²)` cancels exactly). Mercury validation: ~43.0 arcsec/century within 0.5 arcsec; v0.5.0 GL4 geodesic cross-validation to relErr 1.77×10⁻⁷.

**Rationale**: Anchors the catalog's GR sector with a precision-validated timelike-geodesic observable; serves as the calibration bridge for the geodesic-integrator pipeline (Part-IX C-series).

**Bridge Equation 53: Yang-Mills One-Loop β-Function (Asymptotic Freedom)** *(Category L: Quantum Field Theory Extensions)*

> **AST encoding:** [`src/bridges/equations/be-53-yang-mills-beta.ts`](../../src/bridges/equations/be-53-yang-mills-beta.ts) (`BetaFunctionNode`, single-coupling form)

- **Status**: Established. One-loop renormalization-group running of the non-Abelian gauge coupling in Yang-Mills theory; Nobel Prize in Physics 2004 (Gross & Wilczek 1973 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 30:1343; Politzer 1973 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 30:1346; Peskin & Schroeder 1995 §16).
- **Context**: Bridges quantum ↔ classical regimes via RG flow; structural dual of BE-39's asymptotic-safety NGFP — BE-53's UV fixed point sits at `g* = 0` (asymptotic freedom) rather than at a non-Gaussian point, demonstrating that the `BetaFunctionNode` primitive is flow-direction-agnostic
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cbeta(g)%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7Bb_0%20g%5E3%7D%7B16%5Cpi%5E2%7D%20%2B%20O(g%5E5)%2C%20%5Cquad%20b_0%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B11%7D%7B3%7DC_2(G)%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7B3%7DT(R)N_f" alt="\beta(g) = -\frac{b_0 g^3}{16\pi^2} + O(g^5), \quad b_0 = \frac{11}{3}C_2(G) - \frac{4}{3}T(R)N_f" />

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/C_2(G)" alt="C_2(G)" /> is the adjoint Casimir (`N_c` for SU(N_c)); <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/T(R)%20%3D%201%2F2" alt="T(R) = 1/2" /> for fundamental Dirac flavors, giving `b₀ = (11/3)N_c − (2/3)N_f`
- `b₀ > 0` ⇒ asymptotic freedom (coupling → 0 in the UV)
- Pinned values: QCD (SU(3), N_f = 6) `b₀ = 7`; pure SU(3) `b₀ = 11`; asymptotic-freedom boundary `N_f = (11/2)N_c ≈ 16.5` for SU(3)

**Dimensions**: `[β] = [1]` (dimensionless — `β(g) = k ∂_k g` is the derivative of a dimensionless coupling with respect to `log k`; same signature as BE-39).

**Rationale**: Completes the RG-flow sector begun by BE-39 with an `established`-status anchor, pinning the catalog's β-function machinery to a Nobel-validated result.

**Bridge Equation 54: Randall-Sundrum Brane Cosmology (Modified Friedmann)** *(Category E: Cosmological-Quantum Bridges)*

> **AST encoding:** [`src/bridges/equations/be-54-randall-sundrum-brane.ts`](../../src/bridges/equations/be-54-randall-sundrum-brane.ts) (`FriedmannEquationNode`, `variant: 'brane'`)

- **Status**: Speculative. Real, self-consistent extra-dimensional framework (RS II single-brane model), but experimentally unconstrained (Randall-Sundrum 1999 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 83:4690, arXiv:hep-ph/9905221; Binétruy-Deffayet-Ellwanger-Langlois 2000 *Phys. Lett.* B 477:285, arXiv:hep-th/9910219; Maartens-Koyama 2010 *Living Rev. Relativity* 13:5, arXiv:1004.3962).
- **Context**: Bridges quantum ↔ cosmological regimes: the brane tension `σ` is set by the 5D Planck/AdS scale, so the high-density correction is a quantum-gravity effect on classical cosmology — the same Category-E framing as BE-19 (LQC) and BE-20 (vacuum energy)
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/H%5E2%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B8%5Cpi%20G%7D%7B3%7D%20%5Crho%20%5Cleft(1%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Crho%7D%7B2%5Csigma%7D%5Cright)%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CLambda%7D%7B3%7D" alt="H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho \left(1 + \frac{\rho}{2\sigma}\right) + \frac{\Lambda}{3}" />

where:

- <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Csigma" alt="\sigma" /> is the brane tension; the correction factor `(1 + ρ/(2σ))` is dimensionless (`ρ/σ` cancels `[M L⁻³]`)
- At `ρ ≪ σ` the equation reduces to classical Friedmann; correction = 3/2 at `ρ = σ`, = 2 at `ρ = 2σ`
- `H² ≥ 0` always (unlike LQC's bounce form, which can vanish)

**Dimensions**: `[H²] = [T]⁻²` (same signature as BE-19's Friedmann variants).

**Rationale**: Exercises the `FriedmannEquationNode` `'brane'` variant slot, giving the catalog a second early-universe high-density correction structurally distinct from LQC (BE-19) and vacuum energy (BE-20).

### 6.2 Consistency Matrix

> **Known-issue note (see also Part-V §19.2):** The consistency requirements below — `det(C) != 0` AND all eigenvalues `lambda_k >= 0` — are **not simultaneously satisfiable in general** given the allowed {-1, 0, +1} entry values. For a real symmetric matrix with off-diagonal entries in {-1, 0, +1}, requiring positive-semi-definiteness (all eigenvalues >= 0) combined with non-singularity (det != 0) is equivalent to strict positive-definiteness, which generally rules out configurations with -1 off-diagonal entries. Treat this definition as **aspirational / target-for-future-reformulation**, not as an operational criterion. See Part-V §19.2 for the **canonical replacement (balance-theoretic, Harary 1953)**; the Gram-form alternative was retired in Wave J Tier C6 (per Math M-I8: the embedding was unspecified, leaving the check parametric). Use the balance-theoretic check exclusively.

#### 6.2.1 Entry-construction recipe — illustrative *(added 2026-05-05, Wave L Tier C, per CONV-3 iter-3 — Math C3 + Phys C5)*

> **Why this is needed (CONV-3 iter-3):** the balance-theoretic check that replaced `det(C) != 0 ∧ λ_k ≥ 0` is well-defined as a structural test (Harary 1953), but it is **operationally empty** without a recipe for assigning the actual `C_ij ∈ {-1, 0, +1}` to the 780 off-diagonal pairs. "Mutually reinforcing / independent / contradictory" is not an operational predicate — it requires per-pair physics judgment. Wave L Tier C provides a candidate recipe, applies it to two worked example pairs, and explicitly states the recipe is **illustrative, not authoritative**: full population of the 780-entry matrix requires the per-pair physics judgment of a domain expert, which is precisely the deep open question the framework is supposed to address.

**Candidate recipe (illustrative).** Given two bridge equations `BE_i` and `BE_j`, assign:

- `C_{ij} = +1` if **both** of the following hold:
  - they share at least one fundamental constant (e.g., both use `ℏ`, or both use `G`, or both use `c`), **AND**
  - their dimensional signatures of LHS and RHS are mutually compatible after a domain-acceptable change of variable (e.g., both produce an entropy density, or both produce a stress-energy density).
- `C_{ij} = 0` if **none** of the following holds: they share no fundamental constants, AND they reference no overlapping symbol families, AND their domains are disjoint (e.g., one is a quantum-mechanical decoherence rate, the other is a cosmological-scale entropy bound). The pair is operationally independent.
- `C_{ij} = -1` if there is at least one **shared physical quantity** (a constant, a state, or a derived observable) that the two BEs assign **mutually inconsistent values or behaviors** (e.g., one BE predicts `dℓ/dt > 0` and the other predicts `dℓ/dt < 0` for the same length `ℓ` under the same conditions).

**Worked example 1 — BE-11 (Caldeira-Leggett quantum-classical decoherence) vs BE-19 (LQC bounce):**

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Shared fundamental constants | `ℏ`, `c` (BE-11 uses `ℏ` for quantum dynamics; BE-19 uses `ℏ` indirectly through `ℓ_P = √(ℏG/c³)`). |
| Symbol-family overlap | Marginal: BE-11's decoherence rate `γ_k(λ)` and BE-19's `ρ_crit` operate at different scales (lab vs cosmological). |
| Dimensional compatibility | LHS dimensions are different categories (decoherence rate `[T]^{-1}` vs critical density `[E][L]^{-3}`); not directly compatible without a thermodynamic embedding. |
| Mutual inconsistency? | None known. The two BEs operate in disjoint physical regimes; the LQC bounce makes no prediction about laboratory decoherence rates, and Caldeira-Leggett makes no prediction about cosmological bounce density. |
| **`C_{BE-11, BE-19}` (illustrative)** | **`0`** (operationally independent). |

**Worked example 2 — BE-22 (entanglement-entropy area scaling) vs BE-14 (Ryu-Takayanagi):**

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Shared fundamental constants | None directly displayed (BE-22 uses dimensionless `α`, `γ`, BE-14 uses `G_N`, `ℓ_P` implicitly via the Bekenstein-Hawking 1/4 prefactor). The shared *physics* is the area-scaling principle. |
| Symbol-family overlap | **YES**: both use `S(R)` or `S_A` for an entanglement entropy of a spatial region/surface; both involve a length / area as the scaling variable. |
| Dimensional compatibility | **YES**: both LHS are dimensionless (entropy in nats / bits); both RHS scale linearly with a length-times-coefficient or area-times-coefficient. The BE-22 `S(R) = αL(R) − γ + O(L^{-1})` is the (1+1)D limit of the BE-14 RT formula `S_A = Area(γ_A) / (4G_N)` in `(d+1)`-dimensional bulks. |
| Mutual inconsistency? | None known; BE-22 is a special-case-of pattern of BE-14 in low dimension. |
| **`C_{BE-22, BE-14}` (illustrative)** | **`+1`** (mutually reinforcing — both express the same area-scaling principle in different dimensional regimes). |

**Caveat (per CONV-3 iter-3).** The two worked examples above demonstrate that the recipe can be applied operationally for at least some pairs, but they do not constitute a *proof* that the recipe is well-defined for all 946 off-diagonal entries (44·43/2 unordered pairs; 780 under the original 40-bridge catalog). In practice, populating the full matrix requires:
- a per-pair physics judgment (domain expertise; not all pairs admit a clean verdict),
- a tie-breaking convention for borderline cases (e.g., whether marginal symbol-family overlap counts as `+1` or `0`),
- and a versioning convention for entries that change as bridge equations themselves are reformulated (e.g., BE-30 `R3 invalid` makes all `C_{30, *}` entries undefined after Wave J Tier B; the matrix must be re-evaluated when canonical forms change).

For these reasons the spec's `tractability_class` field on each `BridgeEquation` is set to `'undefined'` for off-diagonal pairs at present; the full consistency-matrix population is **not** a goal of the current framework version. The balance-theoretic check (Part-V §19.2, Harary 1953) is therefore conditional on a future entry-construction recipe being adopted; until then, the check is **structurally well-defined but operationally inactive**.

> **[SUPERSEDED]** The formulation below (det(C) != 0 AND lambda_k >= 0) is kept for historical reference but is not operational — see known-issue note above. Use the balance-theoretic replacement described in Part-V §19.2 instead.
