# `upt` — Universal Physics Tensor CLI

A small command-line interface over the UPT bridge-inference and
canonical-physics suite, for exploring the catalog and the composition graph
**without reading any TypeScript**.

> **Where the tool lives.** The executable is `bin/upt.mjs` (wired to the `upt`
> binary via the `"bin"` field in the root `package.json`). This `cli/` folder
> holds its documentation; it does not relocate the script, so the published
> `upt` command and all `npm run` aliases keep working unchanged.

The CLI is a thin presentation layer. Every command calls the same public API
and internal analysis modules the test-suite exercises — it fabricates nothing,
and it never mutates the catalog.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 18** (the package is ESM, `"type": "module"`).
- A **built checkout**. The CLI loads from `dist/`, so you must compile first:

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run build      # tsc → dist/
  ```

  If you skip the build you'll see:

  > `Could not load the built package. Run \`npm run build\` first.`

---

## Running the CLI

There are three equivalent ways to invoke it. Pick whichever fits your setup.

| Context | Command |
|---|---|
| Built checkout (direct) | `node bin/upt.mjs <command> [args]` |
| Built checkout (npm script) | `npm run upt -- <command> [args]` |
| Installed package | `npx universal-physics-tensor <command> [args]` &nbsp;→ exposes `upt` |

When using the **`npm run upt --`** form, the `--` is required so npm forwards
the rest of the arguments to the script rather than consuming them itself.

Two convenience script aliases also exist in `package.json`:

```bash
npm run explain          # → node bin/upt.mjs explain
npm run bridge-priority  # → node bin/upt.mjs priority
```

### Quick start

```bash
# No arguments → a short demo (explains Hawking temperature, then prints the
# bridge-priority board):
node bin/upt.mjs

# Full usage text:
node bin/upt.mjs help        # also: --help, -h
```

---

## Command reference

19 commands, grouped by what they do. Several accept aliases (shown in
parentheses). Every data-bearing command (all but `help` and `version`)
also accepts `--json` for a machine-readable envelope instead of text — see
[JSON output](#json-output).

### Graph analysis & discovery

8 of these 9 commands (all but `coverage`) operate over a **composition
graph**. Most default to the 44-bridge catalog graph; `map` and `connectors`
default to the combined catalog + canonical graph instead, since they ask
pure connectivity questions (see [The `--source` flag](#the---source-flag)).

| Command (aliases) | What it does |
|---|---|
| `explain <quantity> [inputs…]` | How the graph determines a quantity: identifiability verdict, recovered value, derivation chains, dimensional sufficiency. Given a bridge id (`be-NN`) — a graph *edge*, not a quantity *node* — it redirects to the right tool (`upt confront`/`upt map`), tailored by grounding tier. |
| `priority` (`prioritize`, `triage`) | Triage the speculative bridges by structural **decidability** against established physics (Tiers 1–3). *Not* a credibility ranking. |
| `audit` | Try to derive every bridge by dimensions: which re-derive as a recognized monomial (prefactor recovered), which are decoys, which are dimensionally open. |
| `map` (`linkage`) | Connected components (clusters) of the graph by shared quantities — the anchored core, the link hubs, the isolated tail. With `--format=mermaid\|dot\|svg` it emits the **visual** map (quantities = nodes, equations = junctions colored by status, one subgraph per component); `svg` renders the dot layout via the optional `@viz-js/viz` peer (`npm i @viz-js/viz`). `--proposed` overlays the unadjudicated identity-consequence relations (gray dashed); `--out=PATH` writes to a file. `--equation "TARGET = EXPR"` injects **your own** equation as a violet `user` node, **dimensionally validates it** (✓ consistent / ⚠ mismatch vs the target's catalog dimension), reports where it lands (cluster / shared quantities), and gives a **dimension-based** "did you mean?" (inferring an unknown symbol's dimension) — falling back to name-similarity. A dimensionally non-homogeneous RHS exits non-zero. |
| `candidates` (`propose`) | Propose cross-cluster links (same-dimension quantities in different clusters) for **physicist review**. A coincidence-heavy surface, not discovered bridges. |
| `predict` (`predictions`) | Project the catalog onto the (scale × force) regime plane and rank empty cells as undiscovered-connection hypotheses (triadic closure). |
| `discover` (`discovery`) | **Vet** the link candidates through the inference suite: hypothesise each identification `a≡b` and test whether it merges disconnected physics, unlocks quantities, and stays numerically consistent. Ranks promising / inert / magnitude-clash / contradictory / axis-clash (a stated `scale`/`force` regime mismatch — "identification falsified", not "no connection possible"). Each PROMISING candidate also carries a `[consequence: entailed\|novel-consequence\|inconclusive]` trailer (`src/composition/consequence.ts`) — a machine pre-classifier, not adjudication: `entailed` re-derives a known canonical equation, `novel-consequence` is a valid algebraic consequence with no canonical match, `inconclusive` means none was derivable. Candidates a physicist has already adjudicated (`src/composition/adjudication.ts`) fold out of the printed PROMISING list by default; `--show-adjudicated` lists them again with their recorded verdict. |
| `connectors` (`orphans`) | Of the isolated bridges, which could connect to the anchored core via a same-dimension identification? The structural frontier. |
| `coverage` (`grounding`) | Audit the catalog's empirical grounding — data-confronted vs graph-computable vs encoded-only vs thin. |

### Standard-physics (canonical) layer

| Command (aliases) | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canonical` (`laws`) | List the canonical-equation registry — the textbook "answer key" L-layer, each entry's fidelity (L0/L1/L2), domain, bridge partners, and the coverage gap. |
| `recover` (`recovery`, `validate`) | Validate bridges against standard physics: classify each bridge↔canonical link as `restates-canonical` (F4 circularity — *not* a discovery), `recovers` (undeclared structural match), or `dimensional-only`. |

### Symbolic composition

| Command (aliases) | What it does |
|---|---|
| `symbolic [--simplify]` (`compose-symbolic`) | Compose bridges' **symbolic** (AST) forms, not just their numeric evaluators. Shows the CT-1 / CT-1b chains, dimensionally validated and evaluable. With `--simplify`, folds the composed AST via MathTS (e.g. `k_B` cancels), re-validated. |

### Your own equations

| Command (aliases) | What it does |
|---|---|
| `eval "<formula>" name=value …` (`calc`) | Evaluate **your own** scalar formula (safe — arithmetic only). Knows `pi`/`tau` and `sqrt`/`exp`/`ln`/`sin`/…; any other name must be supplied. |
| `derive <target:dim> <var:dim> … [--formula "<expr>"]` (`dim`) | Derive **your own** equation's dimensional form, and (with `--formula`) verify it and recover the dimensionless prefactor. |

### Data confrontation

| Command (aliases) | What it does |
|---|---|
| `confront [--bridge=be-XX] [--rigor=<tier>] [--frontier] [--sensitivity]` | Run the catalog's committed real-data confrontations — predicted vs observed, each tagged with its **rigor tier** (`[stringent\|moderate\|loose]`) and headed by the distribution ("NOT N equal confirmations"). `--bridge=be-XX` runs one; `--rigor=stringent\|moderate\|loose` filters to a tier; `--frontier` ranks the σ-tests by margin to exclusion (tightest = most at-risk under new data); `--sensitivity` adds the input-elasticity ranking (value-kind only). Not `--source`-parameterized. |
| `axes` (`axis-audit`) | Axis-discrimination audit — which tensor classification axes GATE the discovery funnel (an axis gates only when it MEASURABLY fires). Reproduces the rank-7 measurement: scale+force gate; topology/statistics/symmetry classify but do not gate. |
| `evaluate <be-NN> key=value …` | Numerically evaluate a closed-form / spacetime bridge (BE-51/52/55…65) via its registered evaluator. With no bridge id, lists the evaluable bridges + their input keys. e.g. `upt evaluate be-63 mu_e=2` → M_Ch ≈ 1.44 M_⊙. |
| `ground <a> <b>` | The epistemic-grounding ledger for one discovery candidate a≡b: which falsifiers passed, which abstained (gaps), and the honest permanent ceiling (no mechanism test, no data test). |

### Experimental expression / residual search (Product B)

Orthogonal to `upt discover` (Product A quantity identification `a≡b`, which is **frozen**).
Do not use `probe` to vet identifications; do not use `discover` to search expressions.

| Command (aliases) | What it does |
|---|---|
| `probe <scan\|show\|run\|candidates\|falsify\|rank\|design\|reproduce>` | Bounded expression/residual search. `scan` / `show` list typed frontier gaps (`fg-*`); relation-link and regime-transition gaps are **not searchable** here — use `upt discover`. `run --problem=FILE` enumerates dimensional monomials under a search budget, fits a prefactor on exploratory data only, scores locked holdout, compares `normalForm` to the in-repo corpus, and never prints a status stronger than the stored lifecycle. `no-credible-candidate` is an honest abstention. Optional `--worker=PATH` spawns an NDJSON worker as `node PATH` (no shell, no vendored Python). Experimental subpath: `universal-physics-tensor/probe`. |

### Help

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `help` (`--help`, `-h`) | Print the built-in usage text. |
| `help <command>` | Print that one command's own usage block (e.g. `upt help map`). |
| `version` (`--version`, `-v`) | Print the installed CLI/package version — a bare semver line, e.g. `0.29.0`. |
| *(no arguments)* | Run a short demo. Takes no flags — `upt --json` is treated as an unrecognized top-level command, not a demo flag. |

---

## The `--source` flag

All 8 graph-analysis commands accept `--source=<which>` to choose which graph
the analysis runs over: `discover`, `candidates`, `map`, `explain`,
`priority`, `audit`, `predict`, and `connectors`.

| Value | Graph |
|---|---|
| `catalog` | The 44-bridge catalog graph (8 established + 36 speculative bridges). |
| `canonical` | The standard-physics **L-layer alone** — every canonical equation as an `established` law edge, **with the speculative bridges excluded**. |
| `both` | The bridges **plus** the canonical established-physics backbone. |

**Per-command default:** `discover`, `candidates`, `explain`, `priority`,
`audit`, and `predict` default to `catalog`. `map` and `connectors` default
to `both` — they ask pure connectivity questions ("how does this graph
link together?"), so they answer against all known physics by default
rather than the bridge catalog alone; `--source=catalog` still gives the
catalog-only view for either command.

Running on `canonical` does two things:

1. **Finds candidates from established physics only** — e.g.
   `compton-wavelength ≟ de-broglie-wavelength` — without the speculation that
   pollutes the catalog run.
2. **Acts as a self-consistency check.** Standard physics, fed to the inference
   suite, must introduce no contradiction — so `discover --source=canonical`
   should report **0 contradictory** verdicts.

`--source=canonical` is honest about degenerate cases rather than erroring:
the canonical L-layer is all-established, so `priority --source=canonical`
prints `0 non-established bridges in this graph … triage is vacuous here.`
and exits `0` — it says so instead of printing an empty table.

```bash
# Run the discovery funnel on textbook physics alone:
node bin/upt.mjs discover --source=canonical

# Map the canonical graph's clusters:
node bin/upt.mjs map --source=canonical

# Bridges + canonical backbone together:
node bin/upt.mjs candidates --source=both
```

An unrecognised value exits with an error and status `1`.

---

## JSON output

Every data-bearing command (all 15 — every command in the tables above except
`help` and `version`) accepts a global `--json` flag: instead of the text
report, it prints one JSON envelope to stdout and exits `0`.

```bash
node bin/upt.mjs priority --json
node bin/upt.mjs explain hawking-temperature mass=1.989e30 --json
```

**Envelope shape:**

```ts
{
  command: string;                                  // e.g. "priority"
  source?: 'catalog' | 'canonical' | 'both';         // only on --source-bearing commands
  options?: Record<string, unknown>;                 // e.g. discover's max-orders/anchor
  epistemics?: string;                                // the command's own "review surface, not truth" caveat
  result: unknown;                                    // the same library object the text report is printed from
}
```

**`discover`'s additive fields.** Every candidate in `result` (unless `--derive`
is also set) carries an optional `adjudication: {id, verdict, grounds, source,
date}` when the ledger has one — including folded (`decoy`/`entailed`)
candidates, since `--json` never folds, only the text report does. The
envelope also gains a top-level `adjudicationSummary: {total, genuine, decoy,
entailed, deferred}`, tallied over every candidate in `result` regardless of
funnel bucket. Every `promising` candidate also carries an optional
`consequence: {signal, evidence}` field — `signal` is
`entailed | novel-consequence | inconclusive`, `evidence` is the array of
`{target, governing, derivedNormalForm, canonicalMatch, sourceEquationIds}`
records backing the signal (empty for `inconclusive`). Annotation-only: it
never changes which bucket a candidate falls into.

**Sanitizer contract.** `result` is deep-copied through a JSON-safe sanitizer
before printing, because physics results genuinely contain non-finite numbers
(e.g. `anchoring: Infinity` in the priority board) that `JSON.stringify`
would otherwise silently turn into `null`:

- `NaN` / `Infinity` / `-Infinity` → the strings `"NaN"` / `"Infinity"` /
  `"-Infinity"` (so round-tripping through JSON preserves them instead of
  losing them to `null`).
- Functions are dropped (omitted from objects/`Map`s, `null` in arrays).
- `Map` values become plain objects (string-keyed).

**Errors never emit a JSON envelope.** A failing invocation — bad usage, a
runtime `CliError`, an unknown flag — always prints plain text to stderr and
exits non-zero with **empty stdout**, `--json` or not. That means **zero-exit
stdout is always parseable JSON** on a `--json` invocation; a consumer never
needs to guess whether stdout holds an error payload.

`map`'s visual formats and `--json` are two different output forms — combine
them and the command refuses rather than picking one silently:

```bash
node bin/upt.mjs map --json --format=mermaid
# upt: pick one output form: --json or --format   (exit 2)
```

## Worked examples

```bash
# Explain how Hawking temperature is determined from a solar mass:
node bin/upt.mjs explain hawking-temperature mass=1.989e30

# Triage which speculative bridges are closest to being decidable:
node bin/upt.mjs priority

# List the canonical registry and the bridge↔canonical recovery scan:
node bin/upt.mjs canonical
node bin/upt.mjs recover

# Render the physics map. Mermaid (renders inline in GitHub/Markdown):
node bin/upt.mjs map --source=both --format=mermaid --out=docs/architecture/maps/both.mmd
# SVG in one step (needs the optional @viz-js/viz peer — npm i @viz-js/viz):
node bin/upt.mjs map --source=both --format=svg --out=both.svg
# ...or DOT → SVG via a system Graphviz instead of the peer:
node bin/upt.mjs map --source=both --format=dot | dot -Tsvg > both.svg
# Overlay the unadjudicated proposed relations (gray dashed):
node bin/upt.mjs map --source=both --proposed --format=mermaid
# Inject YOUR OWN equation: dimensional check + where it lands in the graph:
node bin/upt.mjs map --source=canonical --equation "period = 2*pi*sqrt(length/gravity)"
#   → ✓ dimensionally consistent: [time]; joins the anchored cluster via {gravity, length, period}
node bin/upt.mjs map --source=canonical --equation "period = mass"
#   → ⚠ dimensional MISMATCH: RHS is [mass] but the target is [time]
node bin/upt.mjs map --source=canonical --equation "period = uu / gravity"
#   → ⚠ 'uu' is unknown — by its inferred dimension, did you mean: speed?
node bin/upt.mjs map --source=both --equation "photon_energy = h * nu" --format=svg --out=mine.svg

# Compose symbolic bridge forms, then simplify the composed AST:
node bin/upt.mjs symbolic --simplify

# Evaluate your own formula (Hawking temperature, SI units):
node bin/upt.mjs eval "hbar*c^3/(8*pi*G*M*k_B)" \
    hbar=1.054571817e-34 c=299792458 G=6.6743e-11 \
    M=1.989e30 k_B=1.380649e-23

# Derive your own equation's dimensional form and recover its prefactor:
node bin/upt.mjs derive period:time length:length gravity:acceleration \
    --formula "2*pi*sqrt(length/gravity)"

# Run every committed real-data confrontation:
node bin/upt.mjs confront
# Just be-37 (Cassini Shapiro-delay PPN gamma), with the deciding-measurement
# elasticity ranking:
node bin/upt.mjs confront --bridge=be-37 --sensitivity
```

### Input syntax notes

- **`explain` inputs** are either a set of `name=value` pairs (numeric anchor,
  used to recover values) **or** a set of bare `name`s (treated as "known but
  unmeasured"). If any argument carries a numeric value, the whole set is read
  as values; otherwise as names.
- **`eval`/`derive`** read `name=value` pairs for the supplied variables.
- A **`<dim>`** in `derive` is a named dimension (`length`, `time`, `mass`,
  `velocity`, …), a constant (`hbar`, `c`, `G`, `k_B`, `e`), or an explicit
  exponent form like `L^3.M^-1.T^-2`.

## Reading the output

The discovery-style commands print **review surfaces, not discoveries**. A
`promising` verdict means "worth a physicist's minute", not "true"; a shared
dimension is a weak prior. The commands say so in their own headers — take them
at their word. The triage/`priority` ranking is about **decidability**, which is
orthogonal to whether a bridge is correct.

**`discover`'s adjudication fold-out.** Some PROMISING candidates have already
been put to a physicist (recorded in `src/composition/adjudication.ts`, sourced
from `docs/research/*-adjudication.md`). This is **review memory, not a
re-litigation prompt**: it never touches the catalog or the funnel itself
(`rankDiscoveries` is unchanged) — it only annotates what the command prints.
Only the `decoy` (dimensional coincidence, no mechanism) and `entailed`
(real physics, but already carried by the L-layer — not a new link) verdicts
fold a candidate out of the default PROMISING listing; `deferred` and
`genuine` verdicts stay listed, each with an `[adjudicated: …]` trailer giving
the verdict and its grounds. When any of the PROMISING set carries a verdict,
an `adjudicated: N of the M promising carry recorded verdicts (…) — …` line
is printed underneath so the shorter list never looks inconsistent against the
funnel count above it. Pass `--show-adjudicated` to re-list the folded
candidates.

## Flags summary

| Flag | Commands | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--source=catalog\|canonical\|both` | `discover`, `candidates`, `map`, `explain`, `priority`, `audit`, `predict`, `connectors` | Choose the graph (default `catalog`; `map` and `connectors` default to `both` instead — see [The `--source` flag](#the---source-flag)). |
| `--json` | All 15 data-bearing commands | Emit a machine-readable JSON envelope instead of text; see [JSON output](#json-output). Not combinable with `map --format=mermaid\|dot\|svg` (exit 2). |
| `--format=text\|mermaid\|dot\|svg` | `map` | Output format. `text` (default) is the linkage printout; `mermaid`/`dot` emit the visual map source; `svg` renders it (needs the optional `@viz-js/viz` peer). |
| `--proposed` | `map` (with `--format`) | Overlay the unadjudicated identity-consequence relations as gray-dashed junctions. |
| `--out=PATH` | `map` (with `--format`) | Write the diagram source to a file instead of stdout. |
| `--equation "TARGET = EXPR"` | `map` | Inject your own equation as a violet `user` node; reports where it lands + a "did you mean?" hint. Multi-word quantities use underscores (`photon_energy` → `photon-energy`). |
| `--max-orders=N` | `discover`, `map` (with `--proposed`) | Tune the magnitude-clash threshold (default `3`); `map --proposed` shares `discover`'s parsing, so it reshapes the proposed overlay too. |
| `--anchor=k=v[,k2=v2]` | `discover`, `map` (with `--proposed`) | Override the numeric anchor (default `mass=M_sun`) for the consistency/closure check. |
| `--show-adjudicated` | `discover` | Re-list PROMISING candidates that carry a recorded `decoy`/`entailed` verdict and would otherwise fold out of the printed list, each with its verdict + grounds. |
| `--simplify` | `symbolic` | Fold the composed AST via MathTS. |
| `--formula "<expr>"` | `derive` | Verify the derived form and recover its dimensionless prefactor. |
| `--debug` | `eval`, `derive` | Print the active formula-parser kind to stderr. |
| `--bridge=be-XX` | `confront` | Run only that confrontation (`be-37`, `BE-37`, or bare `37` all accepted). Omitted, runs every registered confrontation. |
| `--sensitivity` | `confront` | Add the deciding-measurement elasticity ranking for value-kind confrontations (n/a for `upper-bound`/`consistency`/`table`-kind). |
| `--rigor=<tier>` | `confront` | Filter to one rigor tier (`stringent`/`moderate`/`loose`); a bad tier → exit 1. |
| `--frontier` | `confront` | Rank the σ-tests by margin to exclusion (smallest first — most at-risk under new data). |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Bad `--source`/`--format` value, empty `--out=`, an invalid or unregistered `confront --bridge` value, the optional SVG renderer is missing, or the built package could not be loaded. |
| `2` | Usage error: missing required argument, parse error, unknown command, an **unknown/mistyped flag** (e.g. `--sourc=canonical`), a malformed or dimensionally non-homogeneous `--equation`, or combining `--json` with `map --format=mermaid\|dot\|svg`. |

---

## Hardening

**Unknown flags are rejected, not silently ignored.** This is the one
behavior change from earlier releases: a mistyped or unsupported flag (e.g.
`upt discover --sourc=canonical`) used to be swallowed without effect; it now
exits `2` with a diagnostic naming the bad flag and the command
(`upt: unknown flag '--sourc' for 'discover' (see upt help discover)`). Every
command's flag set is fixed and typed — a flag valid on one command but not
another (e.g. `upt derive --source=catalog`) is rejected the same way, since
`--source`/`--json`/etc. are per-command, not global.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Could not load the built package."** Run `npm run build` first. The `upt`
  binary (`bin/upt.mjs`) is now a thin shim — it resolves and imports
  `dist/cli/main.js`, where all the real logic lives (`src/cli/` compiled by
  `tsc`); the CLI still runs entirely from `dist/`, never from `src/`, so the
  build-first requirement is unchanged.
- **Windows cold-start.** The test suite (run by `prepublishOnly`) has a 3–5 min
  cold-start tax on Windows; the CLI itself does not, but publishing uses
  `npm publish --ignore-scripts` to skip it. The CLI resolves `dist/` paths via
  `pathToFileURL`, so absolute Windows paths work under Node's ESM loader.
- **`npm run upt` swallows my flags.** Use the `--` separator:
  `npm run upt -- discover --source=canonical`.
