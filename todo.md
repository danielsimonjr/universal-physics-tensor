## Latest shipped

- **v0.5.1** (2026-05-19) — Stability/hygiene patch on v0.5.0 GR foundations. 22 task commits across 8 phases. Constants canonicalization (new `src/core/constants.ts` flat exports); diagnostic propagation (`scanForMetricPair` walks v0.5.0 curvature kinds); type-safety hardening (bianchiResidual 6× `any` → `import type`); test-coverage backfill (connection-validators ~250 LOC, fresh-label, flat-Minkowski curvature zero-tests, real Mercury N-orbit Picard); algorithmic dedup (contractRiemannJS, makeSchwarzschildContext); `pderiv.ts` opt-in 4th-order; 5 LC doc-vs-code skews; 7 zombie `it.todo` retired. **Honest framing: PC-1 hypothesis REFUTED** — BE-37 Shapiro residual stayed at 2.51e-4 after constants migration (not <1e-5 as audit predicted); root cause is integrator-driven (see `docs/planning/v0.6.0-Brainstorm.md` "PC-1.5 investigation"). Suite 1595/1597. npm: `universal-physics-tensor@0.5.1`. Tag `v0.5.1`, HEAD `bd98028`.
- **v0.5.0** (2026-05-18) — GR foundations. 25 tasks across 4 phases. GL4 symplectic integrator on canonical (x, p) state (Picard inner solver), bisection perihelion finder, curvature layer (RiemannTensorNode AST + ricci/einstein/bianchiResidual helpers). Both v0.4.0 `it.skip` debts cleared: BE-52 Mercury Δφ to relErr 1.77e-7 (10⁴× tighter than I6 target); BE-37 Shapiro to relErr 1.76e-4. Bridge validation sweep: BE-51/52 structural siblings + BE-17/20/45/46/50 physics anchors + 42-bridge catalog integrity test. Suite 1,554/1,563. npm: `universal-physics-tensor@0.5.0`. Tag `v0.5.0`, HEAD `e2c84b2`.
- **v0.4.6** (2026-05-18) — Minimize/simplify pass. 25 tasks across 5 tracks. 32 audit findings addressed. Suite 1,487/1,496. npm: `universal-physics-tensor@0.4.6`. Commit `46ff0a7`, tag `v0.4.6`.
- **v0.4.5** (2026-05-17) — Refactor + benchmark scaffold. 12 tasks. Bridge-test-helpers DRY consolidation across 39 files. `bench/` infrastructure + AD/BE-37/geodesic baselines. First UPT npm publish ever. Commit `90caf7e`.

## Active queue

(Empty — v0.5.1 shipped 2026-05-19. Next release: v0.6.0 brainstorming queued at `docs/planning/v0.6.0-Brainstorm.md`.)

### v0.5.1 execution lessons (carry-forward for v0.6.0+)

- **Audit hypothesis can be empirically wrong.** PC-1's prediction that `c_SI` drift dominates the BE-37 Shapiro residual was REFUTED via Tasks 1+4 measurement. The constants canonicalization was still net-positive hygiene but the residual is integrator-driven. Pattern: every audit prediction with a numerical target should be RED-test-verified before being declared "shipped". Honest negative results are valuable.
- **Eve (OpenAI o3) hallucinated 5/9 audit-vet challenges.** Fabricated `src/core/constants.ts` (didn't exist pre-Phase-1), NYC coverage report (no NYC), BE-60 v0.6.x branch (no such bridge), JIT micro-benchmarks (none), v0.5.0-rc2 (no rc tags). See `feedback_eve_o3_hallucinations.md`. **Always grep-verify Eve's specific-evidence claims.** Use her for severity-recalibration judgment (3/3 correct there) not fact-claim verification.
- **The c²-cancellation noise pattern is the v0.5.1 silent footgun.** It manifested twice: Task 16 (Minkowski curvature tests) had to switch to unitless `c=1` fixture; Task 4 (Schwarzschild fixture migration) had to escalate by migrating 3 consumer test files because the cycloid blew up at relErr 3.4e-6. Anywhere SI metric carries `c²` scale (~6e16 on g_tt), 2nd-order FD propagation is at risk. PD-7's opt-in 4th-order `pderiv` is the v0.5.1 mitigation; future bridges differentiating `c²·g_tt` should use `{ order: 4 }`.
- **Multi-agent file-disjoint parallelism is a real strategy.** Phases ran in parallel-batches (Phase 1 + my Phase-3 doc edits concurrently) with zero merge conflicts because we strictly partitioned file scope. CHANGELOG.md was the single read-modify-write contention point — kept sequential.
- **Adam+Eve MCP availability is fragile.** llm-gemini and llm-openai MCPs disconnected mid-cycle; required `/kill-plugins` + `/reload-plugins` recovery. For v0.6.0+ adversarial vets, consider Opus subagents as a built-in fallback (per Daniel's v0.5.1 directive when MCP was down).

### Notable v0.5.0 execution lessons (load-bearing for v0.6.0+ planning)

- **Two plan-correctness bugs slipped past Adam+Eve adversarial review** and were only caught at TDD-RED:
  1. Schwarzschild Riemann formula: plan template wrote leading-order `2GM/r³`, correct coordinate-basis form is `r_s/(r²(r-r_s))` (off ~33% at r=3·r_s). Caught Task 0. Memory: `feedback_v0_5_0_plan_template_riemann_bug.md`.
  2. Ricci contraction slot: plan + design + S1 correction all wrote `lowerIndices[0]`, correct is `lowerIndices[1]` (Carroll Eq. 3.91). Caught Task 7 via de-Sitter `R=4Λ` failing to vanish. Memory: `feedback_v0_5_0_ricci_contraction_bug.md`.
- **4th-order finite-difference stencils** required for ≤1e-9 Riemann lowering accuracy — the c²·g_tt ~ 6e16 scale causes catastrophic cancellation at 2nd-order. v0.4.0 `pderiv` defaults need scrutiny anywhere SI-c² metrics are differentiated.
- **Curvature-layer pattern** (first-class AST node `{kind, …refs}` + walk-directly lowering; no AST rewrite, no contraction-graph) crystallized across Riemann/Ricci/Einstein/Bianchi. Next curvature-layer addition (Weyl? Bianchi-2nd-form?) is the threshold to extract a shared `CurvatureCompositeNode<K,S>` factory.
- **GL4 + Picard inner solver** is shape-agnostic: null geodesics worked without Picard pathology (Task 12). Mercury matched GR closed-form to 7 sig figs (Task 10). The symplectic Hamiltonian flow does not care whether `g^μν p_μ p_ν` is timelike or null.
- **Cross-bridge `c` constant inconsistency** discovered Task 11: `src/numerical/be37-covariant-eikonal.ts` uses `c = 2.998e8`; `evaluateShapiroDelay` uses exact `299792458`. Dominant ~1.8e-4 BE-37 residual. **v0.5.0+ cleanup item.**

## Deferred from prior releases

### From v0.4.0
- [x] ✅ **BE-52 Mercury perihelion geodesic cross-validation** — shipped Task 10 of v0.5.0. relErr 1.77e-7 (10⁴× tighter than ±2×10⁻³ target).
- [x] ✅ **BE-37 full Shapiro cross-check** via geodesic integration — shipped Tasks 11+12 of v0.5.0. relErr 1.76e-4.

### From v0.4.5
- [ ] **Vitest 4.1.4 async-bench reporter limitation** documented in `docs/architecture/benchmarks.md`. Per-bench hz tables not emitted for async benches; only BENCH Summary ratios. Watch for vitest 4.2+ which may fix this.

### From v0.4.6
- (None — all 32 audit findings landed)

### From v0.5.0
- [x] ✅ **`c` constant canonicalization** — shipped v0.5.1 Theme A (Tasks 0-4). New `src/core/constants.ts`. **BUT PC-1 hypothesis REFUTED**: BE-37 Shapiro residual still 2.51e-4 (not <1e-5 as predicted). Real cause is integrator-driven — see `docs/planning/v0.6.0-Brainstorm.md` "PC-1.5 investigation".
- [ ] **`schwarzschildRiemannFn` fixture is pragmatic-minimum** (8 of 256 entries populated). Deferred — out of v0.5.1 scope, carry to v0.6.0 if needed for new RiemannTensorNode consumers.
- [x] ✅ **Plan/design Ricci-slot bug** — annotated v0.5.0-Implementation-Plan.md with post-S1 addendum in v0.5.1 (Task PD-3/LC-2).
- [x] ✅ **GL4_LONG=1 Mercury 100-orbit Picard-convergence test** — wired in v0.5.1 Task 17 (PD-4). `solveGL4Stage` has iteration counter; gated test asserts `failureFraction < 0.001`. Default 20-orbit (~6 min); `GL4_LONG_ORBITS=100 GL4_LONG=1` for release-prep.

### From v0.5.1
- [ ] **PC-1.5 investigation** — BE-37 Shapiro residual floor (currently 2.51e-4). Hypothesis: integrator-driven (GL4 step count at O(h⁴) truncation floor for 1500s coord-time, OR null-IC reconstruction noise from sqrt + sign-choice ~5e-15 abs accumulating). Investigate via: (a) step-count sweep (2048 → 4096 → 8192) to bracket the floor; (b) bench harness for null-IC reconstruction variance. Detail in `docs/planning/v0.6.0-Brainstorm.md`.
- [ ] **BR-2 carry-forward**: `christoffelFn` nested-array → `Float64Array(64)` flat — breaking, 2-3× RK4/GL4 speedup. Pull in v0.6.0 design phase.
- [ ] **AS-3 (optional)** test-side `schwarzschildPin` helper — deferred from v0.5.1; ~65 invocation sites of `schwarzschild*Fn(M)([0, 3*r_s, π/2, 0])` could collapse. v0.5.2 polish if needed.
- [ ] **Bench harnesses (PO-1, PO-2)** — deferred from v0.5.1 (Phase 7 skipped). Add `bench/gl4-picard-alloc.bench.ts`, `bench/ricci-lowering.bench.ts`, `bench/pderiv-grid.bench.ts`. Bench-gated perf commits if alloc cost >5% wall-time.

### From v0.4.5
- [ ] **Vitest 4.1.4 async-bench reporter limitation** — upstream-blocked. Watch for vitest 4.2+.

## Conventions

### Repo state
- **UPT repo**: `~/Dropbox/Github/universal-physics-tensor`, branch `master` (NOT `main`). Direct-push workflow, no PR flow.
- **MathTS sister repo**: `~/Dropbox/Github/Mathts`, branch `main`. Houses `@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor` and `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd`. Both published to npm.
- **npm publish on Windows**: use `npm publish --ignore-scripts --access public` to bypass the slow `prepublishOnly` hook (vitest startup on Windows ~3-5 min; the suite is verified at every task commit, so re-running it at publish time is redundant).
- **NPM_TOKEN**: stored at Windows User-level env var. `~/.npmrc` and `~/Dropbox/Github/Mathts/.npmrc` use `${NPM_TOKEN}` interpolation. Token rotation: regenerate at https://www.npmjs.com/settings/danielsimonjr/tokens, then `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('NPM_TOKEN', '<new>', 'User')`.

### Plan + audit doc locations
- `docs/planning/v0.X.Y-Design.md` — design (per brainstorming skill)
- `docs/planning/v0.X.Y-Implementation-Plan.md` — implementation plan (per writing-plans skill)
- `docs/planning/v0.X.Y-Review-Findings.md` — Adam+Eve adversarial review findings
- `docs/architecture/` — auto-generated dependency graph + hand-written architecture docs + per-release audit reports (e.g., `v0.4.6-minimize-targets.md`, `bridge-coverage-audit.md`)

### Reasoning tier
- For UPT specifically, **Adam (Gemini 2.5 Pro) + Eve (OpenAI o3)** are the default review-tier models. Invoke liberally on design review, adversarial cross-check, physics-correctness verification.
- MCP llm-tools are TEXT-ONLY — inline source content into the `prompt` string when asking Adam/Eve to verify code claims.

### Memoryjs-driven audit tooling
Re-runnable codebase analysis via `~/Dropbox/Github/memoryjs/tools/create-dependency-graph`:
```bash
cd ~/Dropbox/Github/memoryjs/tools/create-dependency-graph
npx tsx create-dependency-graph.ts --root="C:/Users/danie/Dropbox/Github/universal-physics-tensor" --include-tests
```
Re-run before any future minimize/audit/refactor release.

### Plan-template imperfections (known pattern)
Plan-writing subagents produce illustrative inline test templates that often have wrong tensor-input formats / wrong AST node kinds / wrong method names. Implementers at execution time MUST cross-check against existing fixtures and correct as needed; honest deviation documented in commit message. Examples from v0.4.5/v0.4.6: incorrect nested-array shapes in covariant-derivative tests, `op:'*'` vs `kind:'tensor-product'`, `evaluateNumericalRaw` claim to bypass `validate()` (it doesn't), wrong method names (`f64.mul` vs actual). Pre-execution verification gates on risky tasks are the systemic mitigation — the v0.5.0 plan has these on Tasks 0, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12.

### Adam+Eve review process for design and plan docs
Both design AND plan get adversarial-reviewed. For v0.5.0: design caught 19 findings (notably the Ruth-4-not-symplectic-on-non-separable-Hamiltonian showstopper that Adam missed but Eve caught); plan caught 25 MORE findings including the ricci-slot reintroduction (plan-writing reintroduced a bug the design had fixed) and the Picard-masquerading-as-Newton showstopper. **Never assume the plan inherits the design's fixes** — review the plan independently.

### How to update this file
- When a task completes: flip `[ ]` → `[x]` AND move it to the "Latest shipped" section if it represents a release
- When a new task is identified: add it to the appropriate section (active queue / deferred)
- Keep the "Latest shipped" section to 3-5 entries; older releases roll off into `CHANGELOG.md` for historical record
- Commit this file alongside the work it tracks (it's NOT in `.gitignore`)
