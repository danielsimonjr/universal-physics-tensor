## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **`upt path` quoted a bound outside the regime it is claimed in** (outside-user persona finding
  L1, 2026-09-25). At `--at theta0=0.8` it printed the pendulum bound, `delta = 0.0159`, and
  "horizons all hold", although `ab-pendulum-linear` claims that bound only for θ0 ≤ 0.5. The
  exact relative period error at θ0 = 0.8 is 2K(sin 0.4)/π − 1 = 0.0415 (AGM), which is 2.6 times the
  printed bound. The command checked only each bound's time horizon, never its regime. It now
  checks the regime of every bridge on the path at the `--at` point and prints `regimes at --at:
  VIOLATED — no bound on this path is claimed at this point`. It prints UNKNOWN when a coordinate is
  missing, and VACUOUS when no bridge states an inequality. `--json` gains `regimes` (per-bridge
  `ok`, `violated`, `unchecked`) and `allRegimesHold` (`true`, `false` or `'unknown'`). Both fields
  are additive. The help text states the regime check.
- **The discovery magnitude gate counted a graph identity as evidence** (persona finding L3).
  `thermal-wavelength ≟ planck-length` was "promising" with `magnitude (1.1 orders, anchor-derived)`
  under *passed*, and `upt ground` showed no gaps. The anchor sets the temperature to the Hawking
  temperature of the anchor mass M, and then h/√(2π M k_B T_H) = 4π ℓ_P exactly, for every M
  (log10 4π = 1.099). The magnitude agreement is therefore fixed by the graph and tests nothing.
  Checked at M = 1 kg, 10¹² kg and M☉: the ratio is 12.566 each time, and the funnel's own
  thermal wavelength is 2.0310 × 10⁻³⁴ m at both M☉ and 10³ M☉. The funnel now re-evaluates the
  graph with every anchor input times 10³. It sets `magnitudeAnchorInvariant` when an
  anchor-derived magnitude ratio does not move, and the grounding ledger then lists the magnitude
  under *gaps* ("anchor-invariant … an identity, not evidence"). A magnitude clash stays a clash.
  The flag fires on 4 catalog candidates; only this one was a pass. The verdict, still `promising`,
  is unchanged: magnitude is not one of its conditions.
- **`upt explain` called one bridge written twice "independent derivations"** (persona finding
  L5). For `hawking-temperature mass=1.989e30` it reported "2 independent derivations (be-42,
  be-42-via-rs). They agree … — a passing consistency check". The two edges are BE-42 in M and in
  r_s: ℏc/(4π k_B r_s) with r_s = 2GM/c² is ℏc³/(8πGM k_B), so their agreement is algebra. The value
  itself, 6.1684 × 10⁻⁸ K, is correct (independent recomputation: 6.16843 × 10⁻⁸ K). The summary now
  counts independence by catalog bridge (`BridgeEdge.beId`): "2 derivation routes … restate ONE
  bridge (BE-42) … agreement by construction, not an independent check". Routes over several
  distinct bridges are counted as such. `DerivationExplanation` gains `beId` (additive). Three
  goldens change by that summary line (`demo-no-args`, `explain-bare-names`, `explain-mass-value`).
- **A relative-error convention was stated nowhere, and one counterexample read it the wrong way**
  (persona finding W1). The `ab-kg-schrodinger` counterexample said that at x = ck/ω₀ = 1 "the
  non-relativistic kinetic frequency is 17% too high". It is ω₀/2 against the exact ω₀(√2 − 1), so
  it is **20.7% above the exact value**. 17.2% is the gap over its own value, 3 − 2√2. Every relative
  `delta` in the atlas divides |exact − reduced| by the REDUCED model's value. A new test,
  `tests/atlas/relative-norm-convention.test.ts`, recomputes all six from closed-form physics at
  the edge of each domain: the pendulum (elliptic K by AGM), telegraph → Fick, telegraph → wave,
  Klein–Gordon → wave, Klein–Gordon → Schrödinger, and stiff → flexible string. Every numeric
  `delta` was already correct under that convention. The six `norm` strings now end ", normalized by
  the value of the reduced model", `ApproximationBound.norm` documents the rule, and the
  counterexample states both numbers. `data/atlas/*.json` were regenerated with
  `bun run atlas:json`, and the `atlas-pendulum` golden changes by the norm line.
- **`upt discover` called a label mismatch a falsification** (persona finding L4). The AXIS-CLASH
  header read "identification falsified (stated regimes differ)" over 70 pairs, while the funnel
  line on the same screen counted "0 contradictory (falsified)". An axis clash compares the stated
  `scale`/`force` labels of the two quantities and computes nothing. The header now reads
  "stated scale/force labels differ: a regime-label prior, not a physical test", and the funnel
  reads "contradictory (numerically falsified)". The `discovery.ts` doc comments, `cli/README.md`
  and `DATAFLOW.md` say the same. The verdict enum, counts and ranking are unchanged. Four
  `discover` goldens change by those two lines.
- **`upt confront` showed a derived number as be-51's "observed" deflection** (persona finding L6).
  It printed "observed 1.751639983367098 ± 0.000105 arcsec". VLBI measured PPN γ = 1 − (0.8 ±
  1.2) × 10⁻⁴, not a solar-limb deflection to 16 digits. The "observed" value is the prediction
  times (1 + γ)/2, reproduced to every printed digit. The residual, 0.67σ, was already right,
  because it tests only γ. The line now reads "derived (1+γ)/2 × predicted = …", with a second
  line "measured: PPN γ = 0.99992 ± 0.00012 (VLBI); the value above is derived from it, not
  observed". The `value` outcome gains an optional `measured` field (additive), which `--json` and
  `data/bridge-catalog.json` carry; the catalog was regenerated with `bun run catalog:json`. The
  zero-tolerance confrontation golden (`tests/fixtures/confrontation-numbers.golden.json`) was NOT
  regenerated. The two new input numbers, γ and σ, were added to it by hand, and every existing
  number is unchanged.
- **The GR confrontations take GM☉ from the IAU 2015 nominal value** (Mothership ruling on persona
  finding L6). BE-51 used G × 1.989e30 kg and BE-52 used G × 1.98892e30 kg, which put G·M 3.0e-4
  and 2.6e-4 above the nominal (GM)☉ = 1.3271244e20 m³ s⁻² (IAU 2015 Resolution B3). GM☉ is
  known to about 10 digits and G to about 5. For BE-51 the offset was 5.2e-4 arcsec, five times the
  VLBI 1σ on the deflection. A new internal `GM_SUN_SI` (with `GM_SUN_SOURCE`) is the source, and
  each confrontation uses M = GM☉/G, so G·M is the nominal value exactly. **be-37/51/52 outputs
  shift by about 3e-4 relative:**
  - BE-51 predicted deflection: 1.7517100517691688″ → 1.751190325559984″ (−2.97e-4). The residual
    stays 0.67σ, because it tests only γ.
  - BE-52 predicted Mercury precession: 42.99158858487129 → 42.98056186229095 ″/cy (−2.56e-4). The
    residual goes from 0.263σ to 0.288σ.
  - BE-52 regime bound r_s/r_p: 6.4216e-8 → 6.4199e-8.
  - BE-37 does not move: its prediction is PPN γ = 1 and uses no mass.

  Each new value was recomputed independently from the closed forms before it was pinned. The
  zero-tolerance pins in `tests/fixtures/confrontation-numbers.golden.json` and
  `tests/atlas/gr-spine-regime.test.ts` were re-pinned deliberately, with the old values kept in
  comments. `data/bridge-catalog.json` was regenerated with `bun run catalog:json`. The public
  `M_SUN_SI` (1.989e30) and the be-37/51 solar-limb regime bound, which is built from it, are
  unchanged.
- **`ab-stokes-einstein` states its regime in machine form** (persona finding L8). Its side
  conditions said "Re ≪ 1" and "t ≫ m/γ" in prose, but the regime had no inequality. So `upt
  regime diffusion --at Re=1000` reported it VACUOUS and valid, although Stokes drag, and with it
  D = k_B T/(6πηa), holds only in creeping flow. The regime now has `Re ≤ 0.1` and `m · gamma^-1 ·
  t^-1 ≤ 0.01`. Re is a dimensionless input of the flow. The overdamping group uses the same key as
  `ab-langevin-diffusion`, so one `--at` value checks both bridges. The side conditions state that
  0.1 and 0.01 are chosen thresholds for "≪ 1". This was conditional on no frozen hash moving, and
  none did:
  - the eight pinned code blobs and the eight Criterion 3 file hashes are unchanged;
  - the benchmark items blob is unchanged;
  - `witness-results.json` and `atlas-study-results.md` regenerate byte-identical.

  The `src/canonical` input tree already differed from `freeze.json` before this session: the
  change is at dbd4e95, which registered Amendment 9. `data/atlas/{atlas,diffusion}.json` were
  regenerated with `bun run atlas:json`.

- **A user formula is now compared with the canonical equation it restates** (persona finding L2).
  `upt map --equation "period = pi*sqrt(length/gravity)"` and `upt derive … --formula
  "mass*velocity^2"` answered "✓ consistent" and "MATCHES", although each is wrong by a constant.
  Dimensional analysis cannot see a prefactor, and the output did not say so. When a canonical
  equation has the same target and the same non-constant variables, both commands now evaluate
  the two formulas at three fixed points, where variable i takes (1.7 + i)^p for p = 1, 1.3, 1.6.
  The output is identical on every run. They report one of:
  - **agrees**, prefactor included;
  - **differs by a constant factor**, with the ratio `yours/canonical`;
  - **differs in FORM**, when the ratio is not constant across the points;
  - **prefactor NOT checked**, with the reason.

  The last one matters for the persona's own two examples. `src/canonical` records CE-pendulum-period
  only dimensionally and CE-kinetic-energy only up to a constant (its AST is m·v²), so a wrong 2π or
  ½ still cannot be caught there. The output now says so instead of staying silent. `src/canonical`
  is a pinned Criterion 3 input tree, so recording those prefactors needs an amendment. When no
  entry matches, the output says the prefactor is not checked. Checked computation:
  `hawking_temperature = hbar*c^3/(4*pi*G*mass*k_B)` reports the factor 2.00000 against
  CE-hawking-temperature (4π for 8π). The exact form reports agreement. A 1/M² variant and T ∝ ℓ/g
  report a difference in form. A same-scale point design would have hidden the T ∝ ℓ/g case, because
  every ratio between variables stays fixed; the per-variable bases were chosen after a test caught
  that. In `derive`, a variable counts as a constant only when its name AND dimension match one:
  `c:length` stays a length. The `--json` envelopes gain `canonicalComparisons` (additive). New
  internal module `composition/canonical-compare.ts`. The `derive-formula` and three
  `map-equation` goldens gain the comparison line.
- **`upt probe` compares a fitted prefactor with the prefactor of the corpus relation it matches**
  (persona finding L7). On finite-amplitude pendulum data (θ0 up to 2.5 rad), probe found √(ℓ/g)
  with ĉ = 7.387 and marked it "equivalent to CE-pendulum-period (not novel)", although the
  small-angle law has 2π = 6.283. `normalForm` matches up to a constant, so the new
  `corpusPrefactorNotes` evaluates the corpus relation against the candidate at three fixed
  points to get the corpus prefactor. It then prints one of:
  - "fitted ĉ agrees with X's prefactor" (within the holdout tolerance);
  - "fitted ĉ contradicts X's prefactor (+N%): the data may lie outside that relation's regime";
  - "X records no prefactor, so the fitted ĉ is not compared with it".

  Only a fully quantitative canonical entry records a prefactor. CE-pendulum-period is dimensional
  only, so the persona's own case now reads "records no prefactor" rather than being flagged: the
  same data limit as L2. Checked on CE-friedmann, H² = (8π/3) G ρ: true data give ĉ = 8.378,
  "agrees", and data 20% high give ĉ = 10.05, "contradicts … (+20%)". `ProbeSearchResult` gains
  `prefactorNotes` (additive).
- **`upt path --at` prints the PROVEN bound at the point, beside the domain supremum** (persona
  finding L9). The path printed only the supremum over each bridge's declared domain: for the
  pendulum, 0.0159 at any θ0. At θ0 = 0.2 the true period error is 0.0025, and for
  `ab-damped-massless` the supremum, δ = 3, exceeds the unit signal. `ApproximationBound` gains an
  optional `deltaAtBasis`:
  - `'closed-form'` means `deltaAt` is the exact error, so a proven bound that holds with equality;
  - `'numerically-supported'` means witnesses support it, but no proof covers it.

  Six approximations are closed-form. `ab-damped-massless`'s 2(1 + |v0|) m/b is numerical (witness
  W8b). `upt path` prints "bound at this point: K = 1 · delta = 0.002505744228602058 (closed-form: the
  exact error; the composed bound above is the supremum over the bridge's domain)" only when every
  regime holds and every step is closed-form. Otherwise it prints "none" and the reason, for
  example "ab-damped-massless's point bound is numerically supported, not proven". A new test checks
  the pendulum `deltaAt` against the exact error at θ0 = 0.1, 0.2, 0.35 and 0.5. The exact error is
  computed by Simpson quadrature of the elliptic integral, independent of the AGM the code uses, and
  the two agree to 1e-9. The five other closed forms are checked at an interior point. `--json`
  gains `pointBound` and `pointBoundReason` (additive).

## [0.46.0] - 2026-09-24

### Release summary

- **Deprecated: `BridgeEquations.crossingResidual`.** It is physically WRONG, and it will be REMOVED in
  0.47.0. Use `crossingEquation`. The "Deprecated (2026-09-24)" entry below gives the detail.
- **The model atlas, ROADMAP Phases 0–6, is delivered.** It holds typed relations between physical
  models:
  - three families (oscillators, diffusion, waves), with 24 models and 20 bridges over 6 relation types;
  - regimes, and error bounds that carry their horizon;
  - evidence tags that are derived, never set;
  - one reviewed `formalRef`;
  - the invalid-bridge benchmark, with 125 model-authored frozen items;
  - the study.
- **UPT is DONE** (owner, pre-registration Amendment 12). Every ROADMAP §7 criterion is measured and
  reported: MET, NOT MET, amended or deferred. Two are NOT MET, and they are the study's findings:
  - **Criterion 2, invalid-bridge rejection:** the atlas rejected 6/61 invalid items, and the best
    local LLM (qwen3.8:27b) rejected 51/61. The atlas abstains on 116/125 and makes 1 wrong accept,
    against 9 to 13 for the LLMs.
  - **Criterion 3, retrieval of the established relation:** the typed structural search found 12/50,
    and a local embedding model (qwen3-embedding:4b) found 49/50.
  - **Amended or deferred:** human κ, the practical-value and curation-cost criteria, the independent
    physicist review, and ≥ 5 reviewed `formalRef`s (1 of 5).
- **Future work, not started:** hybrid retrieval, where embeddings find the candidates and the atlas
  verifies them (ROADMAP §8).
- **Dependency health, measured for this release:** `bun audit` finds 0 vulnerabilities in 129
  packages. `bun outdated` shows:
  - minor dev updates (`@types/node`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `fast-check`);
  - vitest 5 available (a major);
  - the optional `@danielsimonjr/mathts-*` peers behind their latest releases.

  No dependency changes in this release.

### Fixed (2026-09-24) — the pre-push gate refused every annotated tag

- **The gate compared the wrong sha.** git passes each pushed ref to `pre-push` as "<local ref> <local sha>
  <remote ref> <remote sha>". For an annotated tag the local sha is the TAG OBJECT's, not the commit's, so
  the check "the pushed commit is HEAD" refused every annotated release tag, the v0.46.0 tag included, although
  the tag named HEAD.
- **The check is now `tools/gate-inputs/pushed-head.ts`.** It peels each sha to the commit it names before the
  comparison, and the hook calls it. `tests/tools/pushed-head.test.ts` has 4 cases. The annotated-tag case
  FAILS when the tool is reverted to the raw comparison.
- Release tooling only: the npm package is unchanged.

### Changed (2026-09-24) — UPT is DONE: the owner accepts the measured verdicts (pre-registration Amendment 12)

Mothership relayed the owner's words verbatim (21:29 CDT): "(a) for now. (b) as a future ROADMAP using embedding with Qwen3-embedding:4b."

- **Amendment 12** records the decision. DONE means that every ROADMAP §7 criterion is measured and
  reported, and UPT is DONE on that basis. Criteria 2 and 3 are NOT MET, and they stand as the study's
  findings.
- **The ROADMAP §7 header** says so.
- **A new ROADMAP §8, Future (not started), holds one entry:** hybrid retrieval. qwen3-embedding:4b
  finds the candidate relations (49/50 in criterion 3), and the atlas verifies them (1 wrong accept,
  against 9 to 13 for the LLMs).

### Added (2026-09-24) — criterion 3 VERDICT: NOT MET (pre-registration Amendment 11)

The embedding condition was scored after Amendment 11 was committed (`b6916ab`) and its CI run was
green (36084344662, 2026-09-25T02:01:31Z). The scorer checked every Amendment 8 and 11 pin first.

- **PRIMARY (n = 50), the criterion's pool:**
  - embeddings (qwen3-embedding:4b, frozen vectors): 49/50 = 98.0% [89.5%, 99.6%];
  - typed structural search: 12/50 = 24.0% [14.3%, 37.4%].
- **The verdict is NOT MET.** The typed interval does not lie above the embedding point estimate.
- **In-distribution:** 30/30 for embeddings, 0/30 for typed search. Fluid statics (held out): 19/20
  for embeddings, 12/20 for typed search.
- **SECONDARY (n = 64):** 63/64 = 98.4% against 15/64 = 23.4%.
- **Variance, disclosed and not scored.** A second embedding pass is not byte-identical: min cosine
  0.9972, mean 0.9994 over 232 vectors. It gives the same 49/50, and no truth query crosses the depth
  cut. The file is committed beside the frozen one.
- **A negative result, recorded as one.** On this task, finding the established relation that a claim
  restates or misuses, a local embedding model beats the atlas's typed structural search by a wide
  margin.
- **Criterion 2 stands as measured, NOT MET.** No re-run is planned (Mothership).
- `atlas-study-results.md` now includes the verdict section, and a note marks the older INTERIM
  wording. Its other content regenerated unchanged.
- The ROADMAP §7 Phase 1 row now says that the two browser checks are deferred by the owner.

### Added (2026-09-24) — criterion 3: pre-registration Amendment 11 registers the embedding condition before it is scored

- **Registered, as Amendment 8 requires, before any score:**
  - the model, qwen3-embedding:4b, which LLMBench's final class 6 ranks best on search, and its digest;
  - the query instruction;
  - the pinned code (`embedding.ts`, `run.ts`);
  - the SHA-256 of the frozen vector file, `docs/research/criterion3/embeddings/qwen3-embedding-4b.json`
    (2,560 dimensions, 107 records, 125 queries, embedded once).
- **The verdict rule is restated before the score.** The typed search scored 12/50 [14.3%, 37.4%], so
  the criterion is NOT MET at an embedding recall of 8/50 = 16.0% or more.
- **`tools/criterion3-study/embedding.ts`:** embeds once, ranks by cosine with the id tie-break, and
  scores through the runner's own scorer. It refuses to score unless the Amendment 8 and 11 pins
  match AND the amendment's commit and CI result are given.
- **Disclosed:** that last guard came after one early scorer invocation had computed a score. Its
  output was cut before any number was shown. Amendment 11 records the event.
- `UPT_OLLAMA_URL` sets the Ollama address. `OLLAMA_HOST` is the server's bind address
  (`0.0.0.0:11434`), not a URL, so the script does not read it.
- **Architecture-doc counts** updated for the two new files, from `repo_map`: 868 source files,
  3,097 exports, 887 type-only imports; tests 478, tools 22.

### Changed (2026-09-24) — Sprint 4 and Sprint 5 tracker rows closed by amendment; a gate observation

- **Ticked, titles unchanged, with Mothership's OK.** Each row has a child line that names its
  amendment:
  - Sprint 5, by Amendment 6: κ amended;
  - Sprint 4, by Amendment 10: the formalRef exit criterion is deferred by the owner.
- **`NOTES.md` records an observation, not a cause.** The pre-push gate did not run for the `cd4f0d5`
  push, because `core.hooksPath` was set to the absolute `.git\hooks`. A plugin review worktree was
  created at 14:02, but the mechanism is unproven. The setting is restored, and the stale worktree
  and its merged branch are removed.

### Changed (2026-09-24) — the owner DEFERS the Phase 4 reviewed-`formalRef` criterion and the citation work

Mothership relayed the owner's words verbatim (15:02 CDT): "I feel that UPT is burning a lot of tokens for a long time on citations we can resolve another time. We're not trying to turn this project in a paper right now. It's mainly an exploration project."

- **Pre-registration Amendment 10** records the criterion "≥ 5 bridges with a reviewed
  `formalRef`" as DEFERRED at 1 of 5. It is not met and not closed. It no longer blocks DONE. The
  PhysJS proofs are deferred with it.
- **Marked "deferred - owner 2026-09-24 15:02":**
  - the criterion's `todo.md` row, with a child line, so the row title is unchanged;
  - the two browser checks in `docs/research/phase-1-citation-check.md` (von Klitzing 1980 eq. 4;
    Shapiro 1964 eq. 1).
- **Updated to match:** the ROADMAP §7 Phase 4 row and `NOTES.md`.
- **Nothing was deleted.** No other open citation or provenance row exists in `todo.md`. The Zenodo
  DOI row is publication work, so it stays open and unworked.
- **Criterion 3 is NOT deferred.** Its task, finding the established relation that a claim restates
  or misuses, is the vetting that the project exists for. The embedding condition still waits for
  LLMBench.

### Added (2026-09-24) — Phase 4 formalRef scoping report

`docs/research/phase-4-formalref-scoping.md` answers Mothership's five questions about the Phase 4
criterion "≥ 5 with a reviewed `formalRef`", which stands at 1. It is a report, with no code change.

- **The one reference** is `ab-pendulum-linear` → Physlib `linearizedEquationOfMotion_iff`, fidelity
  `sanity-lemmas`.
- **"The proofs need PhysJS" agrees with the ROADMAP definition.** No library holds a statement to
  point at, so new proofs are necessary, and PhysJS is the out-of-tree place for them. PhysJS is an
  empty, private scaffold, held by the owner. A private proof cannot be checked by readers of the
  public package, and the axiom gate checks only `lean4-physlib` references.
- **Per bridge, no exact counterpart exists outside the one recorded.** The search covered Physlib
  (`5ad56e24` and HEAD `1c81053a`), Mathlib (`bd6c1abe`, and `5ed29652` as Physlib pins it), and, by
  a read-only subagent, Coq/Coquelicot, Isabelle, HOL Light, HOL4 and Mizar. One weaker counterpart
  exists, for `ab-walk-diffusion`: the fixed-time central limit theorem (Mathlib, Isabelle, HOL
  Light). Its Mathlib axioms were measured against the pinned checkout, with a `sorry` control.
  d'Alembert exists only in the converse direction (Physlib; Coquelicot, partly `Admitted`).
- **Candidates for new proofs:** five dispersion-limit bridges have closed-form error functions, so
  short lemmas could certify `bound.delta` exactly. The costs are estimates, not measurements.
- **The report opens with the owner's decision:** the criterion is deferred (the next entry). The
  missing counterparts are the expected result, for two reasons on two sets:
  - the catalog bridge equations are the owner's own work, so no external source is expected;
  - the 20 atlas bridges are textbook relations, but formal libraries hold almost no physics PDEs.
- **`TOOLS.md`:** GitHub code search can miss a quoted phrase that exists. A positive control caught
  it, so the report used identifier searches only.

### Changed (2026-09-24) — triage of the stale open `todo.md` rows outside the atlas roadmap

The triage row named lines 654, 658, 830-844, 943 and 985. Rows inserted since then moved them by
+38, to 692, 696, 868-882, 981 and 1023, plus the optional rows 1405, 1409 and 1450. Each was
checked against evidence. A row was ticked, box only, when the evidence showed it done.

- **Ticked:**
  - **P10, collaboration surface.** Its three deliverables shipped: the research note, the catalog
    artifact v2 and the issue templates.
  - **DGT diagnosis 2026-07-02.** Its four actionable gaps are closed. The watch items are notes,
    not tasks.
  - **The COMPONENTS.md stale-header follow-up.** The header no longer names v0.10.0, and a design
    doc carries no version.
  - **The criterion 3 "design the task first" row (Sprint 5).** The task was designed and frozen by
    Amendment 8, and its in-process conditions ran.
- **Kept open, with the reason:**
  - **Phase 5 frontier (692):** an open research program.
  - **The 2026-07-04 "NEXT" block (696):** BE-21 is confronted, but BE-53 is not.
  - **be-16 and be-38 (868, 878):** no confrontation exists; one is data-pending and one is
    contingent.
  - **be-23 (873):** the aggregate is confronted, but the per-material table upgrade is not done.
  - **be-12 (882):** a recorded design-time deferral, not unfinished work.
  - **Canonical name unification (1405):** still valid. It is the naming gap that criterion 3
    exposed, and it must wait: changing canonical entries now would break the frozen study's
    registry check.
  - **Symbolic forms (1450):** future work.
  - **The optional mathts peers (50):** all its children are done, but the row itself asks for a
    future alignment release.

### Fixed (2026-09-24) — BE-48 credits the linear law to GRW, not CSL (F2); the BE-35 spec sum rule follows Rattazzi et al.

- **BE-48 (census finding F2).** The name said "(CSL extension)" and the context said "GRW / CSL",
  crediting the linear mass law `λ_0 (m/m_0)` to CSL. Bassi & Ghirardi 2003 derive it for GRW/QMSL,
  as the centre-of-mass amplification `λ_macro = N λ_micro` (§6.4). They give CSL a different
  macroscopic rate, `γ D_0 n_out` (§8.3).
  - The name is now "GRW mass-amplified localization rate", and the context credits §6.4 and states
    the CSL rate from §8.3.
  - The module docstring stops crediting Ghirardi, Pearle & Rimini 1990 with "rate λ ∝ m/m_0".
    Pearle 1989 is marked not seen, as in `references[]`.
  - A correction is appended to the history `notes`, and the spec BE-48 section gains a
    "Corrected on 2026-09-24" block.
  - The name was not verbatim spec text: the spec heading is "Objective Collapse Equation (GRW
    extension)". `docs/architecture/bridge-coverage-audit.md` is a dated historical snapshot and
    keeps its old wording.
- **BE-35 spec sum rule (Mothership's ruling).** The spec showed `Σ (C12 C34 − C13 C24) F = 0` and
  called F "conformal blocks". That is not Rattazzi et al.'s form. The section now gives their
  eq. 4.4 (g = 1 + Σ λ_O² g_O), their eq. 4.3 (the crossing equation BE-35 encodes), and their eq.
  4.5, the sum rule `1 = Σ p F` with `p = λ_O² > 0` and `F = (v^Δφ g(u,v) − u^Δφ g(v,u)) / (u^Δφ − v^Δφ)`.
  F is a crossing combination of one block. The BE-35 correction block now records the rewrite.
- No number, unit system or relation type changed. `data/bridge-catalog.json` is regenerated.

### Added (2026-09-24) — criterion 3 EXPLORATORY result: residual-form structural search (Amendment 9)

The corrected condition ran after Amendment 9 (`dbd4e95`) was committed and its CI run was green
(36035392889, 17:38Z). Before that, the runner refused to run without the Amendment 9 context. The
result is reported in its own section of `docs/research/atlas-study-results.md`, labelled EXPLORATORY
and POST HOC, beside the criterion and never in its place. Everything before that section, including
the Amendment 8 results, regenerated byte for byte.

- **PRIMARY (n = 50):** 12/50 = 24.0% [14.3%, 37.4%], the same as the pinned typed search. It is 0/30
  on the in-distribution families and 12/20 on fluid statics.
- **SECONDARY (n = 64):** 14/64 = 21.9%, one hit fewer than pinned (15). The residual adds the target
  symbol, which moved one symbol-overlap tie.
- **Instrument facts:**
  - structural keys now match in 4 of 11,125 pairs, where the pinned search had 0;
  - 4 of the 12 hits are placed by a key match (q-072, q-082, q-105, q-107), and the rest by symbol
    overlap;
  - one hit (q-043) is still an id tie-break;
  - a separate check found that all 4 key-equal pairs are correct references, so the structural
    tier is precise when it fires.
- **What it means:** the representation mismatch is fixed, and it was not the main reason for the
  misses. The claims restate or misuse their relation in forms that differ from the canonical
  formula (extra terms, different factors, derived quantities), and no structural key equates those.
  The naming gap stays a stated limitation.

### Added (2026-09-24) — residual form for canonical entries; Amendment 9 registers an EXPLORATORY condition

The criterion 3 in-process run found that typed structural search never matched on structure. It had
0 key equalities in 11,125 pairs, because a claim is stored as `lhs − rhs` and a canonical entry as one
target's right-hand side. Mothership ruled that this is a product defect to fix in code, and that the
corrected condition may run only as EXPLORATORY and POST HOC, registered before it runs.

- **Fixed in code: `canonicalResidual` (`src/canonical/residual.ts`)** returns `target − scalarAst`, the
  form a claim is compared in. It was test-first: a residual claim `F − m·a` first fails to key-match
  `CE-newton-second-law`, then matches in residual form. A control (`F − m·v`) still does not match,
  and all 89 canonical residuals pass the dimension validator. The product's typed search switches to
  it after the study closes (filed in `todo.md`), because the Amendment 8 pins are live until then.
  No symbol-alias map was added: the naming gap is a stated limitation.
- **`tools/criterion3-study/residual-corpus.ts`** puts the frozen corpus in residual form. It refuses
  to run unless each frozen expression equals the registry's `scalarAst`, so the targets come from
  the same registry. All 89 match.
- **Amendment 9** (`docs/research/atlas-benchmark-preregistration.md`) registers the corrected
  condition as POST HOC and EXPLORATORY. It keeps the same truth sets, pool and metric, and pins the
  two files above by git blob id. The criterion verdict stays on the conditions as pinned in
  Amendment 8, and the corrected result is reported beside it, never in its place.
- **`run.ts` reads each amendment's own section (`amendmentSection`).** Before, it read from
  "Amendment 8" to the end of the file, so Amendment 9's pins would have been taken as Amendment 8's.
  The exploratory condition runs only when Amendment 9 is present, its pins match, and its commit and
  CI are given. Before Amendment 9, the refactored runner reproduced the committed Amendment 8 results
  byte for byte.

### Added (2026-09-24) — criterion 3 step 4: the in-process retrieval conditions, INTERIM

Amendment 8 (`d99dcc9`) was committed, and its CI run was green (36028162207, 16:36Z), before any
condition ran. The three in-process conditions then ran on the frozen inputs. There is no criterion
verdict yet: criterion 3 compares typed structural search with EMBEDDINGS, and the embedding condition
waits for LLMBench.

- **New `tools/criterion3-study/run.ts` (`bun run atlas:c3-run -- --write`).** It refuses to run unless
  every file hash and pinned code blob in Amendment 8 matches the tree; a tampered `truth.json` was
  refused. It counts the hits directly AND through `recallAtK`, and throws if they disagree. It records
  each query's first-correct rank. `scripts/run-atlas-study.mjs` now includes the criterion 3 section in
  `docs/research/atlas-study-results.md`, and the regenerated criterion 2 and ablation output is
  byte-identical to the committed file.
- **PRIMARY (n = 50), recall@10:**
  - text retrieval 34/50 = 68.0% [54.2%, 79.2%];
  - symbol matching 12/50 = 24.0% [14.3%, 37.4%];
  - typed structural search 12/50 = 24.0% [14.3%, 37.4%].

  In-distribution families (n = 30): text 66.7%, and both expression conditions 0/30. Fluid statics,
  held out (n = 20): text 70.0%, both expression conditions 60.0%.
- **SECONDARY (n = 64):** text 71.9%; symbol matching and typed structural search both 23.4%.
- **Instrument facts, computed by the runner:**
  - the typed structural tier NEVER fired (0 of 11,125 key equalities), so typed search reduces to its
    symbol tie-break, which is why it equals symbol matching;
  - 123/125 queries are `lhs − rhs` residuals, while a canonical `scalarAst` is one target's right-hand
    side, so their normal forms cannot be equal;
  - symbol names follow different conventions (physics notation against descriptive names);
  - 17 of 50 truth queries have no correct reference with an expression;
  - all 12 expression-condition hits are fluid statics. 11 of them rest on the one shared name `g`,
    and 1 is an id tie-break.

  The pinned conditions are not changed after the results. A corrected structural condition would need
  its own amendment, and would be exploratory.
- NOTES.md and the ROADMAP §7 Phase 6 row record the interim state. `TOOLS.md` records the lesson: a
  tier that never fires hides behind its tie-break.

### Added (2026-09-24) — criterion 3 step 3: pre-registration Amendment 8 freezes the labels and the scoring

Criterion 3 must be frozen before any condition runs. Mothership returned the two blind labelers'
files, and this commit records them. No retrieval condition has run.

- **Amendment 8** (`docs/research/atlas-benchmark-preregistration.md`) registers:
  - the task, the corpus (107 entries at `c144150`), the 125 queries with opaque ids, and MODEL labels
    from two blind `claude-opus-5-5` labelers whose tool calls Mothership audited;
  - agreement: exact 99/125 = 0.792, mean Jaccard 0.847 (0.748 without the both-"none" queries);
  - PRIMARY truth: the 50 exact-agreement non-empty queries;
  - SECONDARY truth: PRIMARY plus the 14 partial overlaps, with the truth their intersection
    (n = 64). Excluded: 26 contested and 49 both-"none";
  - the in-process conditions, pinned by git blob ids of the ranking and scoring code;
  - the embedding rule (local model, frozen vectors, registered in a later amendment);
  - scoring (recall@10, Wilson 95%, per family, fluid statics separately), and the criterion's pool:
    PRIMARY over all families.
- **Disclosures in the amendment:**
  - the power at n = 50 is about ±0.109, wider than the design's ±0.07;
  - 49 of 125 claims have no registry counterpart (19 of them diffusion);
  - fluid statics, the held-out family, is 20 of the 50 PRIMARY queries;
  - the 3 "valid" hits are all valid items;
  - the opaque ids and seeded order.
- **Frozen under `docs/research/criterion3/`:** the three label files byte for byte and the derived
  `truth.json`, with the SHA-256 of all seven files in the amendment. The labeler files arrive with
  CRLF line ends and their hash is of those bytes. `.gitattributes` therefore stores them with no
  line-end conversion, and the test hashes raw bytes.
- **New `tools/criterion3-study/labels.ts` (`bun run atlas:c3-labels`)** derives the truth sets.
  `tests/tools/criterion3-labels.test.ts`:
  - binds every amendment hash to its file;
  - re-derives `truth.json` and the counts;
  - checks that PRIMARY equals Mothership's agreed labels, and that SECONDARY uses the
    intersection;
  - fails on a missing label, an unknown id, or a changed label.

  A changed truth file and a changed amendment hash each fail it.

### Deprecated (2026-09-24) — `BridgeEquations.crossingResidual` is physically WRONG; removal in 0.47.0

- `BridgeEquations.crossingResidual` (`evaluateCrossingResidual`) and its ASTs (`BE35_CROSSING_RESIDUAL_RHS`,
  `BE35_FORWARD_BLOCK`, `BE35_CROSSED_BLOCK`) do not state crossing symmetry. They have no
  `v^Δφ` / `u^Δφ` prefactors and describe one conformal block. A zero from them is not evidence of
  crossing, so the evaluator tests nothing. Use `BridgeEquations.crossingEquation`.
- They stay, deprecated, in the next release (0.46.0) to give consumers one release of notice. **They
  are removed in the release after it (0.47.0).** If the next release is numbered differently, they
  are removed in the release that follows it. (Mothership's ruling, 2026-09-24; UPT is 0.x, so a
  minor release may break.)

### Fixed (2026-09-24) — BE-35 encodes the crossing equation, not a single-block residual (census finding F1)

BE-35's encoded relation was `R = C²·[g_block(u,v) − g_block(v,u)]`. That form has no `v^Δφ` / `u^Δφ`
prefactors and is written for ONE conformal block. Neither is crossing symmetric. Its stated check,
"identically zero at the crossing-symmetric point u = v = 1/4", holds for ANY function at u = v, so it
tested nothing.

- **Added:** `BE35_CROSSING_EQUATION_RHS` and `evaluateCrossingEquation`
  (`BridgeEquations.crossingEquation`) compute `v^Δφ·g(u,v) − u^Δφ·g(v,u)`. This is the crossing
  equation for four identical scalars (Rattazzi et al. 2008, eq. 4.3), with `g` the full reduced
  four-point function `1 + Σ λ_O² g_O` (their eq. 4.4). The equation is now the RHS registered for
  BE-35. The dimension is unchanged (`[1]`).
- **Test instrument:** the generalized free field `g = 1 + u^Δ + (u/v)^Δ` satisfies the equation
  exactly at every point off `u = v`. Dropping one term breaks it (a control that fails). A mutation
  that removes the prefactors, which is the F1 defect, fails the test. A test that passed
  vacuously (`undefined === undefined` before the evaluator existed) was hardened.
- **Deprecated, not removed:** `evaluateCrossingResidual` and its ASTs stay, because
  `BridgeEquations.crossingResidual` is public API. Removal is filed for a release.
- **Updated to match:** the BE-35 `encoded_form`, a `known_issues` entry, and a correction in the
  history `notes`. `docs/specification/Part-II.md` gains the AST pointer and a
  "Corrected on 2026-09-24" block. That block also records that the spec's own sum rule is not the
  encoded relation: in Rattazzi et al. (eq. 4.5), `F` is a normalised crossing combination of one
  block, not a block.
- **Review:** Adam (OpenAI) and Eve (Gemini) marked all 9 physics claims correct. Eve also noted that
  the `x1 ↔ x2` constraint (eq. 4.2) is not encoded; per Rattazzi et al. §4 it holds automatically for
  an even-spin expansion, and the module's scope notes now say so.
- **Code-docs:** two input types had no summary line (one new, one preexisting). Both are fixed, and
  the ratchet baseline drops from 155 to 154. A preexisting unused import in the BE-35 test is
  removed.

### Added (2026-09-24) — criterion 3 step 1: the blind-labeler inputs, frozen

Pre-registration criterion 3 (recall@10, typed structural search against embeddings) was not run:
the set had no reference corpus and no atlas-blind label per item. Mothership's design
(`Dropbox/_fleet/specs/2026-09-24-upt-criterion3-design.md`) supplies both. Step 1 builds the two
inputs that two blind model labelers receive. The labelers work outside this repository, because
this session has read `src/atlas/` and must not label.

- **New tool `tools/criterion3-export/` (`bun run atlas:c3-export`).** It writes
  `docs/research/criterion3/`:
  - `corpus.json`: the 107 canonical L-layer entries, pinned at `c144150`. The text is the name,
    domain and assumptions; `expr` is the `scalarAst`, present for 89 entries. It leaves out
    `partnerBridges`, `restatesBridge` and `model`.
  - `queries.json`: the 125 frozen items. The text is the premises and the conclusion; `expr` is the
    item's `expr`. It leaves out the verdict and answer fields.
  - `leakage-report.md` and `freeze.json`, with the SHA-256 of each file.
- **The item ids and the file order carried the verdict.** In 7 of the 8 authoring batches, items
  01-08 are valid and the rest invalid. So the queries get opaque ids `q-001`… in the order of
  SHA-256(seed + item id). `queries-key.json` maps the ids back to the items. It stays in the
  repository and is not given to the labelers.
- **Leakage:** 0 hits for atlas bridge, model or rejection ids, `BE-` ids and item ids. A control
  string found all 6 planted tokens. There are 10 verdict-word hits, all in query texts ("valid
  for ...", "independent of ...", "rotating-wave approximation"). The report lists each one for
  review.
- **The export refuses a tree whose inputs differ from HEAD,** so the recorded pin is true. The
  frozen files are LF in the working tree (`.gitattributes`), so a plain `sha256sum` agrees with the
  freeze.
- **Tests:** `tests/tools/criterion3-export.test.ts` covers the exclusions, the opaque ids and
  order, the scanner (including inputs it must flag), and the frozen files against their hashes and
  a fresh export. Four mutations (atlas fields put back into the corpus text, real item ids kept, a
  case-insensitive `BE` pattern, one byte of the frozen corpus changed) each fail the tests.
- Copied to `Dropbox/_fleet/c3/` for Mothership (the key is not copied). No labels, conditions or
  amendment: those are steps 2-5.

### Added (2026-09-24) — mechanical citation quote check; Phase 1 "zero fabricated assumptions" MET

Mothership ruled that the citation census alone could not support MET. Most final texts carried one
OK from one judgement pass, and pass 2 had approved three texts that pass 3 rejected. The ruling asked
for a pass of a different kind: exact string matches, with no re-judging of wording.

- **New tool `tools/citation-quote-check/` (`bun run atlas:quote-check`).** It checks every quoted
  span and every page, equation or section locator in `docs/research/phase-1-citation-claims.json`
  against the downloaded sources, which are pinned by SHA-256. It uses pdftotext and tesseract. An
  equation label counts only as the last token of its line, not after "Eq." or "Gl.", and near an
  anchor from that equation. Extraction found a bibliography "(4)" and a line-final "Eq. (1)", and
  either would otherwise have passed as a label. A claimed page must show its printed number. Every
  span, label anchor and order span has a negative control: the longest word reversed must not match.
- **CI:** `tests/tools/citation-quote-check.test.ts` checks the matcher and the grading logic. It
  checks that every quote and locator of the 15 comments has a claim, with a paired input that must
  fail. It checks that the captured output came from the current manifest AND the current checker
  code. Mutation tests confirmed that the tests catch removal of the "Eq." exclusion, a label counted
  anywhere in its line, and a REFERENCED fallback that ignores the page.
- **A model code review found 6 defects before the recorded run.** All are fixed. The most serious
  let a REFERENCED grade ignore the claimed page. The others were no control for order checks, an
  English-only reference exclusion, a double decode of HTML entities, no unit tests for the grading,
  and a captured output that CI could not tie to the code.
- **Result: PASS.** 43 MATCH, 6 SNIPPET-ONLY (BE-11), 2 REFERENCED (Shapiro's unreadable label (1)),
  1 BOT-WALL (von Klitzing eq. 4, behind the APS bot check), 1 UNREAD (C6). All 44 controls held.
  Every quoted span matches.
- **Phase 1 "zero fabricated assumptions" is recorded MET** by Mothership's ruling (ROADMAP §7,
  `docs/research/phase-1-citation-check.md`). BE-11 (snippet access), C6, and the two unconfirmed
  equation numbers are disclosed by name. The owner has a two-item browser list.
- `TOOLS.md` and `WORKFLOWS.md` state how to run the check and what to do when a `// source:` comment
  changes.

### Fixed (2026-09-24) — citation census: all 15 `// source:` comments checked against their sources

Mothership ordered the other 9 comments checked, with every overclaimed attribution fixed. The sample
had found 5 of 6 overclaiming. Four model passes with source access (Opus) and a final reading by the
author checked all 15 until no overclaim remained (`docs/research/phase-1-citation-check.md`).

- **Every pass found the same defect in the previous pass's rewrites:** a paraphrase that added a word
  the source did not use. Pass 2 found 5, pass 3 found 4 (2 in the sample's own fixes), pass 4 found 1
  (in text that pass 3 had proposed). The loop converged once each comment quoted its source verbatim,
  with a page or equation, and labelled the rest as this repository's.
- **Fixed comments:** BE-11, BE-21, BE-35, BE-37, BE-48, BE-51, BE-52, BE-55 (both), BE-58 (both),
  BE-59 (both). BE-35's overlay counterexample now quotes the registry reason verbatim, pinned by the
  new `tests/bridges/overlay-registry-quote.test.ts` (RED before the fix). BE-35's transformation now
  states the crossing relation with its prefactors.
- **`references[]`:** BE-48 (the linear law is GRW/QMSL, review §6.4, not CSL), BE-51 (Einstein writes
  2α/Δ), BE-52 (Carroll eq. 7.56 is the apsidal frequency). BE-48's `known_issues` sentence and the
  BE-48 edge mirror in `catalog-tranche.ts` follow.
- **Access is disclosed in the comments:** BE-11 (snippets only), BE-55 TKNN (abstract only), BE-59
  Josephson 1962 (paywalled, not read).
- **Result:** 0 overclaims remain; 13 checked; BE-11 on snippets only; C6 disclosed as unverifiable.
  Whether that meets the Phase 1 criterion is Mothership's ruling (ROADMAP §7).
- **Two findings filed, not fixed:** F1 (BE-35's encoded residual lacks the crossing prefactors) and F2
  (BE-48's name and context credit the linear law to CSL).
- No number, unit system or relation type changed. `data/bridge-catalog.json` is regenerated.

### Fixed (2026-09-24) — citation comments that credited sources with the repository's own claims

An Opus agent with source access checked a seeded random sample of 6 of the 15 `// source:` comments
against the cited sources (`docs/research/phase-1-citation-check.md`). None was fully supported: 5
were partial and 1 unverifiable. Each partial one stated the repository's own derivation, convention
or classification as the source's statement.

- **Fixed:** BE-11 (the "not a limit" label is ours; the book frames a weak-coupling limit), BE-21
  (KSS state the SI value themselves and call the bound a conjecture), BE-52 (Einstein 1915 used
  successive approximation, not the Schwarzschild solution; Carroll now cited as the lecture notes'
  eq. 7.56 that was actually read; ~~its added gloss "states the result"~~ RETRACTED by the census: eq.
  7.56 is the apsidal frequency ω_a, not Δφ per orbit), BE-55 (σ_xy = Ce²/h has the same form in Gaussian units; the SI
  part is the values in ohms), BE-58 (~~Nyquist states no units~~ RETRACTED by the census: he states
  frequency in "cycles per second", p. 112; the SI reading is ours).
- **Outside the sample:** BE-51 cited p. 844, which is the field-equations paper; the deflection is
  announced on p. 831. Corrected, and an unverified Carroll section number removed.
- **Stand:** BE-59, whose paper is paywalled (consistent with Josephson's Nobel Lecture); the BE-21
  name, which is verbatim spec text.
- No record changes a number, unit system or relation type. `data/bridge-catalog.json` is regenerated
  for the `references[]` changes. Checking the 9 unsampled comments is filed for Mothership.

### Changed (2026-09-24) — Phase 0 physicist review closed by amendment (Amendment 7)

Mothership ruled, under the owner's delegation, that a model-persona review does not satisfy
"reviewed by an independent physicist". The criterion is recorded as NOT MEASURED (no human reviewer)
in pre-registration Amendment 7, ROADMAP §7 and `NOTES.md`, with a pointer to the Fable review and its
13 dispositions. The Phase 0 todo row and the review row are ticked as **closed by amendment, not
met**: with Amendment 6 (curation cost), both of Phase 0's open criteria are now amended. No threshold,
item, rater assignment or hash changes.

### Added (2026-09-24) — Phase 0 persona findings D3, D5 and Q-b fixed with new witnesses; D8, Q-c, Q-d, Q-e stand

- **W3b (isochrony) for the cubic-spring rejection.** The linear period is 2π at every amplitude;
  the cubic spring's is not (6.22514 / 6.06066 / 5.51685 at A = 0.5 / 1 / 2, β x0²/k = 0.1). A
  change of variables that rescales time by a constant scales every period alike, so no such change
  makes the two exactly equivalent. The rejection's reason now says the surviving group is necessary,
  not sufficient.
- **W9b (the chain integrated) for chain→wave.** W9 compared two formulas; W9b integrates the chain
  on a ring of 64 masses. The measured ω matches the lattice dispersion within 1e-9, the coarse error
  matches (qa)²/24 within 1%, and superposition holds within 1e-10, which witnesses `linearity`. A
  10% wrong κ and a cubic on-site force each fail it.
- **Findings that stand, each with a test.** D8: the series horizon `4T0/θ0²` is shorter than the
  exact π/2-drift time at every θ0 ≤ 0.5, so it is conservative. Q-c: over 170 ordered model pairs
  no `findPath` route composes two bounded approximations, so no declared `K = 1` touches a composed
  δ; a guard test fails when one does. Q-d and Q-e stand as documented in the review record.
- Every finding of the review now has a disposition. `W3b` and `W9b` join the closed witness list.

### Fixed (2026-09-24) — Phase 0 persona findings D1, D2, D4, D6, D7 and Q-a

- **D2, a wrong number from a bound function.** `dampedOffsetBoundAt` returned `2(1+|v0|)m/b` for
  any `b` and ignored `k` and `x0`; at `m = 1e-3, b = 1, k = 100`, inside the declared regime, the
  true error is more than 20× that value. It now refuses (`Infinity`) outside `b = k = x0 = 1`, the
  only normalisation the record declares, and requires `k` and `x0` like `v0`.
- **D1.** `ab-spring-lc` and `ab-damped-rlc` claimed to preserve the "natural frequency"; the map
  rescales time (W1a: ω_s = 2, ω_LC = 2√2). They now preserve it in units of ω0, and the
  `transformation` states the composed map.
- **D6.** The cubic-spring rejection listed `model-lc` as a premise and as the conclusion; a new
  invariant over every family forbids that.
- **Q-a.** W1b checked `x0·u/x0 = u` and could not fail. It now compares the inverse-mapped
  trajectory with an independent integration of the dimensioned spring, with a 1%-wrong-ω0
  negative control.
- **D4, D7.** The error-algebra header now writes `f̃(x̃)`; the design note's composite bound is the
  pendulum bridge's `(1, δ)`, not the series `θ0²/16`.
- `data/atlas/*.json` regenerated (`bun run atlas:json`). Dispositions are in
  `docs/research/phase-0-model-persona-review.md`.

### Added (2026-09-24) — the Phase 0 model-persona review, recorded with its findings

A Fable model instance, instructed as an independent, skeptical physicist (approved by Mothership),
reviewed the Phase 0 pilot through the `CONTRIBUTING.md` review brief. It confirmed the physics of all
six claims, recomputing every number, and found eight defects (D1-D8) and five qualifications. The
review is recorded in `docs/research/phase-0-model-persona-review.md`, labelled "model-persona review
(Fable), not a human physicist"; each finding has an open todo row and a disposition that is filled in
as it lands. It does not satisfy the "independent physicist" criterion; Mothership ruled that the
criterion is closed by amendment once every finding has a disposition.

### Changed (2026-09-24) — three exit criteria AMENDED under the owner's delegation (Amendment 6)

Mothership made three decisions on 2026-09-23 under the owner's delegation, because each criterion
as written needs people the study does not have. They are recorded as pre-registration Amendment 6,
in the ROADMAP §7 status rows for Phases 0, 4 and 5, and in `NOTES.md`. No threshold, item, rater
assignment or hash changes; the frozen-set hash test still passes.

- **κ:** the reported κ is MODEL agreement (0.984 / 0.978, two instances of one model). Human κ is
  NOT MEASURED. The rater role is not filled with personas: two personas of one model family are not
  independent raters.
- **Criterion 5, practical value:** NOT MEASURED (no human participants).
- **Curation cost per bridge (Phases 0 and 4, criterion 6):** NOT MEASURED; the MODEL cost,
  USD 19.34 for the set, is the reported cost and is labelled as such.
- **Closed by amendment, not done:** the Sprint 5 row that asked for independent human authors and
  two named κ raters. No human authored or rated an item.

### Fixed (2026-09-24) — "three classic tests" named the wrong three; the `'rank-3-lower'` tag explained

- **Physics wording.** The GR evidence spine is perihelion (BE-52), light deflection (BE-51) and
  Shapiro delay (BE-37). Four documents called these "the three classic tests of general
  relativity". The classic three are perihelion, light deflection and gravitational redshift;
  Shapiro delay is the fourth, and redshift is not in the spine. Fixed in the Phase 2 exit criterion
  (`ROADMAP.md`, wording only; the criterion's tests are unchanged), `OVERVIEW.md` and
  `docs/research/README.md`. The dated `docs/research/pi-instrument-results.md` keeps its original
  sentence under a visible correction note.
- **`'rank-3-lower'`.** The tag on the `@public` `CURVATURE_KIND_REGISTRY` entry for the Bianchi
  residual is not renamed (public surface). Its doc comment now says what it means: B_{λμνρσ} has
  five lower indices, and the "3" counts the cyclic terms over (λ, μ, ν).

### Added (2026-09-24) — a second control for the formalRef gate: a hole inside an imported module

`HoleProbe.lean` has its `sorry` in the probe file, so it showed only that the gate sees a hole in
the file it runs. Every probed Physlib theorem is reached through an import of a compiled module.

- **The control.** `formal/physlib/UptImportedHole.lean` is a `module` file with `@[expose] public
  section`, the form of every Physlib file, and proves `(1 : Nat) = 2` with `sorry`. The gate
  compiles it into the checkout's build directory; the compiler writes the same set of files as for
  a Physlib module (`.olean`, `.olean.private`, `.olean.server`, `.ilean`, `.ir`).
  `ImportedHoleProbe.lean` imports it, and the gate fails unless `#print axioms` reports `sorryAx`.
- **What it shows, from the Lean source** (`Lean/Util/CollectAxioms.lean`): for an imported theorem,
  `#print axioms` reads an axiom list that Lean stores in the `.olean` when it writes the file; it
  does not walk the proof. The control shows that the stored list carries `sorryAx` for a hole. It
  does not check how the Physlib `.olean` files were built.
- **A failed compile fails the gate.** The gate deletes the module's old output first and requires
  exit 0 and a written `.olean`, so the control cannot pass on an `.olean` left by an earlier run.
- **Proof.** CI: 25 tests on the captured output, including the new control, an import error, and
  the compile check (`compileProblem`). A mutant that disables the new check turns exactly its test
  red. Live at the pinned checkout: the imported module proven by `rfl` (statement `(1 : Nat) = 1`)
  FAILS the control; a module that does not compile FAILS with the compiler's message although a
  good `.olean` from an earlier run was present; the committed probes PASS.
- **Corrected in review:** the first version was not a `module` file, ignored the compile's exit
  status (a stale `.olean` would have passed), and its README named the wrong limit (`lean -o`
  against `lake build`; `lake build` runs `lean -o` too). `TOOLS.md` and `WORKFLOWS.md` now name both
  controls.

### Fixed (2026-09-24) — untracked files can no longer reach a gate or a generated doc

An untracked `tests/tmp/differential.test.ts` failed the pre-push typecheck, and `bun run
docs:deps` recorded it in the committed test-coverage docs. Both read the working tree, not the
commit. Two root fixes:

- **The generator reads the git index.** `tools/create-dependency-graph/tracked-files.ts` lists
  `git ls-files`, and the generator's two directory walkers keep only those files. It fails loudly
  outside a git work tree rather than fall back to the disk. A new file is included once staged
  (`git add` or `git add -N`); `TOOLS.md` says so. Live proof: with a stray
  `tests/tmp/stray.test.ts` present, `docs:deps` changed no generated file; before the fix the same
  kind of stray moved the test-file count from 440 to 441.
- **The pre-push gates judge exactly HEAD.** The hook now refuses (1) a push whose commit is not
  HEAD, and (2) a working tree that differs from HEAD in any way (`tools/gate-inputs/gate-inputs.ts`,
  the whole tree, gitignored files excepted). It then builds before the typecheck, because
  `tsconfig.tests.json` reads types from the gitignored `dist/`, which CI builds first.
- **Tests:** 16 on throwaway git repositories. Planted strays under `tools/`, `data/`, `bin/`,
  `docs/specification/`, `formal/`, `scripts/`, the root, and an edited `NOTES.md` must each be
  named. A mutant that restricts the check to the first path list tried (src, tests, bench, tools,
  scripts) fails 7 of them.
- **Corrected in review:** the first version gated a hand-kept list of paths, and its test compared
  the list with a copy of itself, so it could not fail; the tests read `data/`, `bin/`, `docs/`,
  `formal/` and `NOTES.md` too. The review also found the stale-`dist/` typecheck and that "the
  pushed commit" was really HEAD.

### Decided (2026-09-23) — no CI credential for the architecture-docs gate

The owner decided, relayed by Mothership: no credential, no publish, and no copy of the private
`skills` tooling into this repository. The architecture-docs gate (`repo_map.py check`) therefore
stays in the pre-push hook only, and the architecture docs are updated by hand from the data of
`tools/create-dependency-graph` until `repo-tools` replaces that tool. The todo row that waited on
this decision is closed; the decision is recorded in `NOTES.md`.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — generated test-coverage docs recorded an untracked file

The previous commit's `docs:deps` run recorded an UNTRACKED file, `tests/tmp/differential.test.ts`,
in `test-coverage.json` (4 entries) and in `TEST_COVERAGE.md` (441 test files; the tracked tree has
440). The file is a differential check for the merged PR #133; no session on this machine wrote it.
It also broke the pre-push typecheck (TS2554), which is how it was found. It is moved, not deleted,
to `%TEMP%\upt-stray-tests-tmp-20260923\` (SHA-256 prefix `5891139a`), and the docs are regenerated
from the tracked tree. The root cause, that the generator and the test typecheck read untracked
files, is filed in `todo.md`.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — source defects found by the architecture-docs audits

Each item was re-checked against the source before the edit. An in-session Sonnet review (not
human) confirmed all of them against the source and the built package.

- **Raw NUL bytes in `src/composition/bridge-prediction.ts`.** The pair-key separator in `pairKey`
  was two raw NUL bytes, present since the commit that created the file (`fcefdf3`). They are now
  written as `\u0000`, the same character at run time. The raw bytes had two effects that no test
  saw: grep printed "Binary file … matches" instead of the matching lines, and the `code-docs` gate
  reported the file UNPARSED, so none of its exported symbols was ever checked. The file now parses
  with 0 findings. A scan of all 1402 tracked text files found no other raw NUL, and the new test
  `tests/internal/no-raw-nul.test.ts` (RED on the old tree, naming exactly this file) keeps it so.
- **`src/numerical/lowering.ts`.** The doc comment for `lowerNode` ("Lower a validated ExprNode…
  @internal") sat about 50 lines above the function, detached from it. It is now on `lowerNode`.
- **`src/dimensional/ast-types.ts`.** `RicciTensorNode.riemann` said the "first two slots" are
  contracted; `ricci()` contracts the upper index with the second lower index,
  R_μν = R^λ_{μλν}.
- **`src/dimensional/einstein-equation.ts`.** The example's stress-energy node used kind
  `'stress-energy-tensor'`, a field `fluidType` that does not exist, and no `symbol`; it now matches
  `StressEnergyTensorNode`.
- **`src/numerical/klein-gordon.ts`.** Two examples imported
  `universal-physics-tensor/numerical/klein-gordon`, which `package.json` does not export; both
  functions are root exports.
- **`src/bridges/index.ts`.** The module doc said 44 entries, 42 of them in
  `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`, and `BridgeEquationEntry.id` said 11-50. Measured: 55 entries (IDs
  11-65), all with a `dimensional_signature`; 53 in `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` (all but BE-51,
  52); 42 with an AST (11-50, 53, 54).
- **`bench/be37-eikonal.bench.ts`.** The header called the covariant evaluator a stub; it now
  integrates with `integrateGeodesicGL4`.
- **`code-docs` ratchet 157 -> 155.** Exactly two findings went away (the UNPARSED file and
  `lowerNode`'s missing doc comment) and none appeared, compared file by file against HEAD.
- **Withdrawn, not changed:** the filed claim that `curvature-composite.ts:31` ("rank-5 lower" for
  the Bianchi residual) contradicts the registry. The comment is correct. The registry's tag
  `'rank-3-lower'` is the misleading part, and lines 55-57 of the same file already say so. The tag
  is on the `@public` `CURVATURE_KIND_REGISTRY`, so renaming it is a public-surface change; it is
  reported to Mothership, not made here.

### Added (2026-09-23) — the Physlib axiom probes and the formalRef axiom gate

The one reviewed `formalRef` (`ab-pendulum-linear`) was checked with two Lean files that no repository
held: `AxiomProbe.lean` (`#print axioms` over six Physlib theorems) and `HoleProbe.lean`, the positive
control (a deliberate `sorry`). They sat untracked in a `%TEMP%` checkout, so a clone at the pinned
commit could not restore them and the control could not be run again. EVO custody found and rescued
them. They are now in `formal/physlib/`, byte-identical to the originals (SHA-256 checked), with the
Lean output captured at the pin.

- **The gate** (`tools/formalref-axiom-gate/gate.ts`, `bun run atlas:formal-gate -- --physlib
  <checkout>`) checks the pin first, then runs both probes and fails when the control does not report
  `sorryAx`, when a probed theorem is missing or depends on `sorryAx`, when a `lean4-physlib`
  formalRef is not probed or records axioms other than the measured ones, or when there is nothing to
  check. Lean exits 0 for a `sorry` proof, so the gate reads the printed axioms, never the exit code.
  It needs Lean and a built Physlib checkout, so it does not run in CI; `formal/physlib/README.md`
  gives the setup.
- **Live proof at the pinned checkout:** the committed probes PASS (exit 0); AxiomProbe with an added
  `sorry` theorem FAILS ("'gateHole' depends on sorryAx", exit 1); HoleProbe with its `sorry` replaced
  by `rfl` FAILS ("positive control failed", exit 1).
- **In CI:** 19 tests run the gate's judgement on the captured output. Mutants that remove the
  `sorryAx` check or the control check each turn exactly one test red. Eight tests added after the
  review fail against the first version of the gate.
- **Corrected after review:** the gate did not check the Physlib pin, so a moved checkout would have
  passed; names containing `'` were misread; an empty probe or reference list passed. All three now
  fail. `captured/**` is LF in the working tree.
- **Disclosed limit:** the control's `sorry` is in the probe file, so it does not show that the gate
  detects a hole inside an imported module. Filed in `todo.md`.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — the captured flaky worker test, and five tests in the same race class

`coverage-backfill.test.ts` "reports worker stderr on nonzero exit" failed the pre-push gate once:
`expected 'worker timed out after 1000ms' to match /exited 2/`. Root cause: `runBackendWorker` arms
its timeout when the launcher returns, so the worker's own start-up counts against the budget.
Measured: `spawn()` returns in about 10 ms and the child then needs about 60 ms idle to boot and exit,
but a bare `node -e` spawn took 843–4307 ms on the loaded host. The test raced a 1000 ms budget
against that start-up. The product semantics (the budget includes start-up) are unchanged and are
now stated in the JSDoc.

- **Root fix, no number changed:** `runBackendWorker` takes an internal launcher seam, `opts.spawn`.
  The test now drives a fake worker that exits on a microtask after stdin closes, so neither
  start-up time nor the clock can decide the result. Two new tests cover the no-stderr exit and the
  launch-error path, which no test covered before.
- **Proof:** a `--require` preload that makes only the `node -e "process.exit(2)"` child sleep
  1500 ms turns the OLD test RED with the exact captured message; the NEW tests pass under the same
  preload. A mutant that drops stderr from the exit mapping turns the new stderr test RED.
- **Same race, five siblings:** the real-worker tests in `backend.test.ts` (echo, rich, malformed;
  5000 ms) and the pipeline tests in `coverage-backfill.test.ts` (echo, invalid; 3000 ms) raced the
  same start-up. They test real NDJSON over real pipes, which a fake cannot, and the protocol has no
  start-up signal, so they now use one shared hang guard, `REAL_WORKER_HANG_GUARD_MS` (30 s, below
  vitest's 60 s), in `tests/composition/probe/worker-hang-guard.ts`, which names the variance
  source. Proof: under a preload that delays only those worker scripts by 5.5 s (control: the echo
  worker took 7016 ms under it, 858 ms without), HEAD's versions fail 5 of 5 and the new versions
  pass 5 of 5. This is a deliberate widening for real-process tests only; the timeout test keeps
  200 ms, which load cannot break. The two scoped files run in 2.19 s, unchanged.
- **No Node types in the declarations:** the launcher is typed by local `WorkerProcess` /
  `WorkerLauncher` interfaces, so no `.d.ts` in `dist` imports a `node:` module.
- **Counts:** the new test module and the two exported types move the whole-repository figures to
  847 files and 3011 exports (50 without an importer); the Verification tables are updated. The
  `src/` figures from `docs:deps` are unchanged (348 files, 2450 exports).
- **Instrument note:** the first sibling proof passed HEAD's tests because a shell heredoc turned the
  preload's `[\\/]` into `[\/]`, so the gate never matched a Windows path. It was rewritten with a
  file tool and given a positive control before the proof was trusted.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — `COMPONENTS.md` in Simplified Technical English

`COMPONENTS.md` is rewritten to STE, prose only, on top of its fact fix. `ste_check` reports 0
findings (it had 76). `verify_rewrite.py` exits 0: every table row, code fence (including the module
diagram) and heading is byte-identical, and the technical tokens are unchanged. Long enumerations
became bullet lists. An in-session Sonnet review (not human) compared every changed sentence and
FAILED two; both are fixed.

- **Corrected after review:** the candidate funnel again says the 36 same-kind candidates are a subset
  of the 98 that touch the anchored core (the rewrite had made them two independent counts). The
  rewrite had added "directly" to "No module in `src/` calls `propagateUncertainty`", which implied an
  indirect caller that does not exist; the word is removed.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — `COMPONENTS.md`: false claims corrected, release history moved out

A read-only Opus audit reported about 230 claims checked, 38 false and 9 that it could not check
(the audit report was a session artifact and is not kept in the repository). An Opus writer re-checked
each claim against the source, and the built package under Node, before editing. A separate Opus
review (in-session, not human) re-measured the result and FAILED four new sentences; all four are
fixed, along with 13 minor points.

- **Stale counts:** 19 data-confronted bridges (was 9), 22 CLI commands in 31 files (was 15 in 27),
  71 `composition/` files (was 47), 55 catalog bridges with IDs 11–65 (was 44, 11–54), 47 bridges
  without a canonical partner (was 36), 13 non-monomial entries (was 10), 0 type-only cycles (was 2).
- **Wrong behaviour:** the per-bridge `evaluate*()` functions are synchronous and return a number;
  only BE-37's eikonal path calls `evaluateNumerical`. `lowerCurvature` is a `switch` and never reads
  `CURVATURE_KIND_REGISTRY`. `ricci` contracts R^λ_{μλν}. The BE-36 and BE-23 uncertainty
  confrontations compute σ inline; no module in `src/` calls `propagateUncertainty`. The default
  engine is `MathTSEngine` when both MathTS peers are installed. The KSS nullary edge is `be21Edge`.
- **Wrong locations and signatures:** `ExprNode` (25 arms) and every tensor, curvature and equation
  node type are declared in `ast-types.ts`; the kinds are `stress-energy` and `einstein-equation`.
  `NumericalInputs`, `evaluateMetricInverse`, `integrateGeodesic`, `integrateGeodesicGL4`,
  `evaluateBE37CovariantEikonalNumerical`, `inferDimensionForBridge`, `christoffelFnFlat` and the
  `MetricTensorNode` fields now match the source.
- **Physics wording:** perihelion and light deflection are two of the three classic GR tests, and
  Shapiro delay is the fourth. Mercury tests (2 + 2γ − β)/3, not β alone. The "~10⁻⁵ precision"
  figure is removed: Mercury's σ/observed is about 1%.
- **Omissions:** `atlas/` is in the module diagram; `B_WIEN_SI` is in the constant list.
- **Stateless:** version labels, dates, task IDs and "now / since / as of" narratives are removed;
  pointers to dated records keep their file names. A "Maintained by" line carrying a personal name is
  removed under the no-personal-name rule for product docs.
- **Retracted in review:** the first draft said `src/atlas/path-bound.ts` uses
  `propagateUncertainty` (it names it only in a comment), that every metric closure returns a
  `Float64Array` (`MetricClosure` and the `killing.ts` closures return `number[][]`), that every
  `be-*.ts` module exports an LHS tree and an inputs interface (31 and 3 of 43 do), and that
  `DEFERRED_EVALUATOR_REGISTRY` is tagged `@internal` (it has no tag).
- **Filed, not fixed here:** an orphaned `@internal` doc comment in `lowering.ts`, and raw NUL bytes in
  `bridge-prediction.ts` that make grep skip the file.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — the five living docs in Simplified Technical English

`PHYSICS_MAP.md`, `benchmarks.md`, `bridge-gradient-tutorial.md`, `intelligent-index-tutorial.md`
and `archive/README.md` are rewritten to STE, prose only, on top of their fact fixes. `ste_check`
reports 0 findings on each (it had 6, 23, 2, 3 and 3). `verify_rewrite.py` exits 0 on each, so every
table row, code fence and heading is byte-identical and the technical tokens are unchanged. An
in-session Sonnet review (not human) compared every changed sentence and found no change of meaning.

- **Corrected after review:** the rewrite added an actor, "the writer", in three `benchmarks.md`
  sentences that had no subject. The vitest bump now names its commit (`28f6f8b`), the 40%-threshold
  sentence says the data cannot support the test, and the pair-iteration sentence says the design
  rejected it.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — `PHYSICS_MAP.md` and `benchmarks.md` corrected against the source

An Opus review (in-session, not human) re-ran every changed figure against the live CLI and the
source and FAILED one passage, which is fixed.

- **`PHYSICS_MAP.md`: the inline canonical map and every count were stale.** The Mermaid block is
  regenerated from `upt map --source=canonical --format=mermaid` and matches it byte for byte. The
  canonical layer is 107 laws: an 83-law core, two two-law clusters and 20 isolated laws (the text
  said 82 and 17 over 103). `--source=both` is 148 edges over 40 components (was 144 over 37). A
  bare `upt map` prints text; the graphic needs `--format`. The `--equation` example outputs are
  replaced with live output. SVG output is now named. The v0.34–0.36 history notes are removed.
- **`maps/*.dot` and `maps/*.svg` regenerated.** The catalog label reads 55-bridge (was 44). A second
  regeneration gave identical bytes.
- **`benchmarks.md`: five figures and descriptions were wrong.** τ_end is ≈ 4.83 ms (the text said
  46.8). The RK4 comparison is 52.6 ms per 1000-step call, ≈ 0.053 ms/step (it said 52.6 ms/step).
  The pre-BR-2 path called `christoffelFn` 4 times per step, 40 000 allocations at 10k steps (it
  said 16 and 160 000). The BE-37 section now says its timings describe the old stub, which `src/`
  replaced with a GL4 integration. The header no longer claims one machine and one date. The
  removed Vitest `benchmarkTimeout` option is noted.
- **Retracted in review:** the first draft said the measured post-BR-2 path reused one scratch
  buffer. The run was at `6e34310` (2026-05-19); the scratch buffer arrived in `c2fc0fc`
  (2026-06-22), which is not an ancestor (`git merge-base --is-ancestor` exit 1). The text now
  attributes the speedup to flat allocation, not to reuse.
- **Left for later (filed, not fixed here):** the header comment in `bench/be37-eikonal.bench.ts`
  still describes the stub.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — the two tutorials and the archive README corrected against the source

A read-only audit (Opus) of the living docs; an Opus review (in-session, not human) ran every new
example and FAILED two passages, both fixed.

- **`bridge-gradient-tutorial.md`: the walkthrough did not run.** It called `bridgeGradient` with a
  `MathTSEngine`, which throws `NumericalBackendError` on the plain-JS catalog evaluators (engine AD
  traces only engine ops). The walkthrough now uses `bridgeGradientNumerical` (verified output:
  value 6.17e-8 K, gradient `{ M_kg: -3.10e-38 }`), and the doc names all four gradient functions,
  including the exact-AD `bridgeGradientAST` / `bridgeGradientASTById` (which need the
  `mathts-autograd` and `mathts-tensor` peers). The package specifier was wrong in both tutorials
  (`@danielsimonjr/universal-physics-tensor`; the package is `universal-physics-tensor`), and a
  see-also path now points into `archive/`.
- **`intelligent-index-tutorial.md`:** `AxisMismatchError` names the shared index id and both
  axes, not operand positions; release-labelled plans ("v0.8.0+") are stated as present fact.
- **`archive/README.md`:** the v0.8/v0.9 records beside the archive are older release records, not
  the current release (the package is at 0.45.x). The audit also called the "v0.4.x through v0.7.x"
  range false; the review showed it is true (v0.4.5 … v0.7.2), so it stays.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — `create-dependency-graph`: long export lists render as fenced blocks

- **Why.** `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`'s 13 Simplified-Technical-English findings were not prose: they were
  generated identifier lists (`- Re-exports: …`, up to 517 words) that read as run-on sentences.
  An identifier list is data, so the generator now renders any export list longer than
  `LONG_EXPORT_LIST_THRESHOLD` (8) names as a wrapped `text` fence under its label; shorter lists
  keep the inline form. `ste_check` on the file: 13 → 0. (The plan had said these findings came
  from source doc comments; they did not.)
- **No data changed, proven.** A names-only extraction of `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` before and after is
  identical: 637 lists, 2,790 names, same order; 29 lists became fences. Positive controls: a name
  altered inside a fenced list and inside an inline list are both detected. `dependency-graph.json`,
  `.yaml` and `dependency-summary.compact.json` are byte-unchanged.
- A generated-format change for `repo-tools depgraph` to adopt (Mothership's approval, carried into
  that spec).

### Changed (2026-09-23) — `ARCHITECTURE.md` in Simplified Technical English, stateless

- 44 STE findings fixed, prose only; `ste_check` reports 0. Long enumerations (the composition-layer
  file list, the GR layers, the L1-sum tier, the curvature evaluators) became bullet lists with the
  same items in the same order. Tables, fences and headings are byte-identical, and every technical
  token is preserved (no allow-lists).
- Written by an Opus subagent under those checks; reviewed independently by Sonnet (in-session, not
  human), which FAILED one passage — "The kinds are ..." made a non-exhaustive list read as complete
  — fixed to "The kinds include ...". All other passages PASS.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — two stale source comments found by the `ARCHITECTURE.md` audit

Comments only.

- `src/dimensional/validator.ts`: the module note said special-function arguments must be
  dimensionless "but the validator does not yet enforce that". It does: a dimensioned
  transcendental argument is an error-severity violation, and a tensor argument throws
  `TensorInScalarOpError` (the `transcendental` arm).
- `src/dimensional/metric.ts`: `derivativeStrategy: 'computed'` was documented as "engine
  auto-differentiates the metric function (default)". The lowering treats a raw-tensor metric input
  as constant (∂g = 0); metric closures in `inputs.fields` take the curvature paths, which
  finite-difference them.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — `ARCHITECTURE.md`: 24 false claims corrected, release history moved out

A read-only full-claim audit (Opus, about 190 claims) found 24 false; the load-bearing ones were
re-checked by the session before editing.

- **How the code works, which the doc had wrong:** per-bridge `evaluate*()` functions are plain JS
  (only BE-37 goes through `evaluateNumerical`), and evaluator code is spread over `equations/`, two
  closed-form modules and `bridges/be55…be65-*.ts`; `derivativeStrategy: 'computed'` makes the
  lowering treat a raw-tensor metric as constant, not finite-difference it; the validator DOES check
  valence homogeneity and dimensioned transcendental arguments; `FreeIndexMismatchError` and
  `TensorInScalarOpError` throw out of `validate()` instead of accumulating; `ok` also requires an
  inferred dimension; the reverse-mode tape is `EngineTape.backward()`; `bridgeGradient` is not
  "analytic" for plain-JS bridges; `numerical/index.ts` does re-export `Float64ReferenceEngine`.
- **Where things live:** `ExprNode` and the curvature/field-equation node types are declared in
  `ast-types.ts`; `parsePhysics` is in `formula-registry.ts`; the union has four more arms than the
  doc listed; `catalog-full.ts` is a barrel over four per-domain edge files; tests live in
  `tests/dimensional/` and `tests/bridges/`, not `tests/unit/…`.
- **Counts:** 55 catalog entries (not 44), 19 data-confronted bridges (not 9), `composition/` has 71
  files (not 47), both cycle counts are 0 (not "two type-only cycles remain").
- **History moved here from the doc:** the v0.9.0 / v0.10.0 / v0.11.0 milestone bullets, the
  v0.28–v0.40 arc, and the per-row release labels (every present fact they carried is kept). The
  suite snapshot the doc quoted — 3,700 passed / 4 skipped / 1 todo (3,705 tests) across 353 files,
  98.5% file coverage (259/263) — is retired history: `TEST_COVERAGE.md` (generated) and `NOTES.md`
  carry the current figures.
- **Review:** an Opus review (in-session, not human) FAILED two corrections as first written:
  more structural errors than two throw out of `validate()` (e.g. `IndexLabelCollisionError`), and
  the stress-energy node kind is `'stress-energy'`, with all eleven curvature/equation kinds
  dispatching through `validator-registry.ts`. It also caught an overclaim (five equation modules
  have no `validate*Dimensions()` helper) and a dropped "contested". All fixed before commit.
- Found by the same audit, filed for a separate commit: two stale source comments
  (`validator.ts:10-11`, `metric.ts:35-39`).

### Added (2026-09-23) — `checkKillingEquation`, a verdict on the relative Killing residual

- `checkKillingEquation(killingFn, metricFn, christoffelAt, x, opts?)` returns
  `{ residual, relativeResidual, withinTolerance }`: `residual` is exactly
  `verifyKillingEquation`'s output, `relativeResidual = residual / max(max|g_μν(x)|, 1)` (the
  normalization `evaluateEinsteinEquationResidual` uses), and `withinTolerance` is
  `relativeResidual <= opts.tolerance` (default 1e-10). A non-finite or non-positive tolerance throws
  `RangeError`. New public surface (function + `KillingEquationCheck`), so a MINOR bump when released.
- **Why relative.** The residual is absolute, in the metric's units. With SI Schwarzschild
  (g_tt ≈ −9e16) the exact time-translation Killing field leaves 2.44e-4 at 3 r_s and 3.05e-5 at
  10 r_s (about 3e-21 relative), so an absolute 1e-10 default would call exact Killing fields
  failing. All numbers were measured under vitest on Node; Bun's JavaScriptCore trig gave a
  different value at one point, which the test file records.
- Tests (`tests/numerical/killing-check.test.ts`, written first): exact ∂_t and ∂_φ pass at 3, 5, 10,
  100 and 1000 r_s; `residual` equals `verifyKillingEquation`'s; pinned `verifyKillingEquation`
  outputs are unchanged; a non-Killing field (ξ = ∂_r) fails the default and passes a looser
  tolerance; a tighter tolerance fails a case the default passes; invalid tolerances throw. Mutating
  the verdict back to the absolute residual turns 6 tests red.
- Decision (ii) of four, by Mothership under the user's delegation; no independent human review.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — `KillingEquationOptions.tolerance` was documented but ignored

- It said "Maximum tolerated residual ... Default 1e-10", but `verifyKillingEquation` never read it
  and returned the raw residual. The option now documents that only `checkKillingEquation` reads it,
  on the relative residual; `verifyKillingEquation` is byte-for-byte unchanged. The module doc's
  "machine precision (~1e-15 or exact 0)" now says RELATIVE, with the measured absolute SI values.
  `tests/numerical/killing-schwarzschild.test.ts` no longer passes `tolerance` to
  `verifyKillingEquation`, which implied the option had an effect.
- API.md, DATAFLOW.md and COMPONENTS.md describe the new function. The four gated
  `totalExports` tables move 3004 → 3008, and the ungated `docs:deps` prose figures are re-measured
  (2450 exports, 1232 re-exports; they had drifted across earlier commits).
  The new test file moves the gated whole-repository `totalSourceFiles` 845 → 846 (tests 465 → 466).

### Changed (2026-09-23) — `OVERVIEW.md` in Simplified Technical English, stateless

- 14 STE findings fixed, prose only; `ste_check` reports 0. Two inline lists became bullet lists
  with the same items in the same order. Tables, fences and headings are byte-identical, and every
  technical token is preserved (one punctuation artifact of the checker's number pattern, `2,` →
  `2`, is declared).
- Sonnet review (in-session, not human): PASS on all 14 passages; its one cosmetic nit (a stray
  space) is fixed.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — the CLI said "44-bridge"; the catalog holds 55, and the label is now derived

- **User-visible:** `upt discover`, `candidates` and `map` printed `[source: catalog (44-bridge)]`. The
  label is now `catalog (${BRIDGE_EQUATIONS.length}-bridge)`, so it prints `55-bridge` today and
  cannot go stale when bridges are added. `src/cli-api.ts` gains `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS` for it (the
  CLI reaches internals only through that barrel). Four CLI goldens change by exactly that banner
  line; `tests/cli/graphs.test.ts` asserts the derived label (it failed first against the old one).
- **The same stale count elsewhere,** removed rather than updated where a comment does not need a
  number: `coverage.ts`, `canonical-graph.ts` (2), `proposed-bridges.ts` (2), `bridges/index.ts`,
  `src/bridges/README.md`, `cli/README.md` (whose table also claimed "8 established + 36
  speculative"; today 19 / 33 / 3), and `PHYSICS_MAP.md` / `bridge-gradient-tutorial.md` (55).
- The new barrel export moves the gated `totalExports` 3003 → 3004 in four Verification tables.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — `OVERVIEW.md`: stale counts corrected, release history moved out

A read-only full-claim audit (Opus, about 115 claims) found 11 false; the session re-checked each.

- **Counts:** the catalog holds 55 bridges, not 44 (four places); the evidence spine is 19
  confrontations (15 established, 4 speculative), not 9; the canonical L-layer holds 107 equations,
  not 103; the North Stars list has four goals, not three.
- **Capability:** symbolic composition and simplification exist
  (`src/composition/compose-symbolic.ts`, `expr-simplify.ts`); the doc called them "eventual".
- **History out of a design doc.** The `## Version History` section (v0.1–v0.40, about 135 lines) and
  the release-by-release `## Roadmap` paragraph are replaced by `## History and plans`, a pointer to
  this file, `ROADMAP.md`, `todo.md` and `docs/planning/`. Every version they named has an entry here,
  and every measured figure they quoted is already here. Two of the audit's false claims lived in that
  section and go with it: "two type-only cycles remain" (both cycle counts are 0) and "`discover`
  defaults to `--source=both`" (it defaults to `catalog`; `map` and `connectors` default to `both`).
  The one standing-status sentence (the physicist-review surfaces) moved to `NOTES.md`.
- Found by the same audit, fixed separately: the CLI labels the catalog source `catalog (44-bridge)`.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — stale source doc comments found while fact-checking `docs/architecture/`

Comments only; no code changes.

- `src/numerical/gl4-integrator.ts`: the module header said it "ships types + Butcher constants
  only" and that `integrateGeodesicGL4` "lands in Task 3"; the module holds the solver and the
  integrator. `GL4Options` and the stage-result JSDoc said "lands in Task 3" / "the upcoming".
- `src/numerical/perihelion-finder.ts`: the `findPerihelion` `@example` called
  `integrateGeodesicGL4` with a signature that does not exist (`christoffelFn`, `x0`, `p0`,
  `gl4.snapshots`). It now shows the real `(GL4State, GL4Options)` call and points to the full
  setup in `tests/bridges/perihelion-precession.test.ts`.
- `src/dimensional/bridge-check.ts`: `inferDimensionForBridge` said bridge ids run 11..50; they run
  to 65.
- `src/numerical/lowering.ts`: the `lowerCurvature` JSDoc said `CURVATURE_KIND_REGISTRY` supplies the
  per-kind spec; the function never reads it.
- `tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`: the header said only BE-11 and BE-14 have
  AST encodings; the test covers every entry of `BRIDGE_RHS_BY_ID` (42).

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — `API.md`: `DuplicateCoordinateWarning` is not a `NumericalResult` warning

- The entry said the warning "appears in `NumericalResult.warnings`". It never does: a
  covariant-derivative coordinate collision throws `MetricSignatureError` by default, and validation
  emits `DuplicateCoordinateWarning` through `process.emitWarning` only when
  `UPT_ALLOW_COORD_SHADOW=1` (`src/dimensional/connection-validators.ts`; the class's own JSDoc in
  `src/dimensional/errors.ts` already said so). The same error was fixed in `DATAFLOW.md`'s error
  table; this is the sibling copy.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — `API.md` in Simplified Technical English, stateless

- 15 STE findings fixed (13 long sentences, 2 ambiguous references), prose only; `ste_check`
  reports 0. Long inline lists (the `*_SI` constants, the 17 confrontation result types, the
  `explainQuantity` and `describeGrounding` outputs) became bullet lists with the same items in the
  same order. Tables, fences and headings are byte-identical, and every technical token is preserved.
- Sonnet review (in-session, not human): PASS on all 14 changed passages.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — `DATAFLOW.md`: 18 more false claims corrected after a full-claim audit

The first `DATAFLOW.md` fact fix checked only the lines it changed, and a claim it left alone (Flow 9's
"failure bucket") turned out false. A read-only audit agent then checked about 150 claims against the
source: 17 FALSE, 2 unverifiable. The session re-read every cited line before editing; all 17 held.
With the Flow 9 item, 18 claims are corrected, and one unverifiable number is replaced by the module's
own statement:

- **Behaviour the doc had wrong:** a dimension mismatch in `+`/`-` is recorded as a Violation, not
  thrown; the default engine is `MathTSEngine` when both MathTS peers are installed; `*`, `/`, `^` are
  computed in JS, not by the engine; forward-mode AD runs once per input element; `lowerCurvature`
  never reads `CURVATURE_KIND_REGISTRY`, and only Ricci and Einstein recurse; Λ is required; the
  residual normalizes each component by `max(|g_μν|, 1)`; `verifyKillingEquation` takes exact
  Christoffels, uses no finite differences by default, and never reads its `tolerance` option;
  junction and dimension refusals in `enumerateCompositions` are skipped; nothing in `src/` calls
  `propagateUncertainty`; `boundPath` has four gates (uniformity is the second);
  `DuplicateCoordinateWarning` is not in `NumericalResult.warnings` (validation throws by default;
  the process warning is opt-in through `UPT_ALLOW_COORD_SHADOW=1`).
- **Names and scope:** the node kind is `'einstein-equation'`; every catalog entry has a
  `dimensional_signature` string; `adjudicateCatalog` returns ids grouped by verdict; confrontations
  include speculative bridges; the discovery verdict precedence is magnitude-clash > contradictory >
  axis-clash, and `promising` also requires a non-subsuming identification.
- **Review:** an Opus review (in-session, not human) FAILED three of the corrections as first
  written: Einstein lowers an inner Ricci node (not the Riemann directly); `dMetricFn` still
  finite-differences ∂ξ; the process warning is opt-in. All three are fixed, and a dropped but
  true clause (signature = `format()` output for encoded entries, pinned by a test) is restored.
- **Filed, not blessed:** the unread `KillingEquationOptions.tolerance` looks like a defect; it is a
  code question for Mothership in `todo.md`, and the doc states current behaviour. The stale
  `lowerCurvature` JSDoc is filed with the other source-JSDoc rows.

### Added (2026-09-23) — `tools/create-dependency-graph`: opt-in API-surface report

- **Why.** Checking `docs/architecture/` against the code meant hand-written greps for each
  signature, `async` flag and stability tag, and two of those loops timed out. The generated data
  had exports and imports per file but no signatures, tags or re-export-resolved surface.
- **What.** A new, repository-neutral module `tools/create-dependency-graph/api-surface.ts`
  (source-text scan; loader and resolver injected; no repo paths) and three opt-in flags:
  `--api-surface=<file>`, `--api-entry=<path>` (default `src/index.ts`), `--stability-tags=a,b`.
  Flags and the `schemaVersion: 1` output schema are in the tool README, for adoption by the shared
  `repo-tools depgraph`.
- **Additive, proven.** The standard outputs (`DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`, `dependency-graph.json` /
  `.yaml`, `dependency-summary.compact.json`, `TEST_COVERAGE.md`, `test-coverage.json`) are
  byte-identical to the unmodified tool's, both without the flag and with it (`cmp`, runs gated on
  exit 0, rewrite confirmed by mtime).
- **Verified against `dist`.** On this repository the report's runtime surface is exactly
  `Object.keys(root)` (289 = 289, none missing either way), all 116 `ALL_TYPE_EXPORTS` appear as
  type-only, and 0 specifiers are unresolved. That cross-check caught a defect before commit:
  comments inside `export { … }` became part of a name and dropped 12 root exports (the same class
  as the tool's earlier C-9 bug); names are now read from comment-masked text, with a test.
- **Tests:** `tests/tools/api-surface.test.ts`, 20 tests, written first. Mutation-checked: a star
  export carrying `default`, dropping the top-level (brace-depth) check, and prefix-matching tags
  each turn a test red (the depth mutant survived the first draft; a case was added for it).
- **Gated counts re-measured.** The two new files move the whole-repository `repo_map` counts:
  `totalSourceFiles` 843 → 845 and `totalExports` 2990 → 3003, in the Verification tables of six
  docs and the prose that restates them. `FILE_INVENTORY.md` drops its note that `repo_map` files
  `tests/tools/plan-doc-audit.test.ts` in the `tools` zone: the upstream classifier fix now files
  it as a test (tests 463 → 465 = that file + the new test; tools stays 13).

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — `API.md` stale facts corrected against the source

A fact-fix commit, kept separate from the Simplified Technical English pass. Every correction was
measured against the current tree or `dist`:

- **Wrong signatures and examples.** `evaluateGravitationalLensing` and
  `evaluatePerihelionPrecession` are synchronous, take `M_kg`/`b_m` and `M_kg`/`a_m`/`e`/`T_yr`, and
  return `alpha_rad` and `dphi_rad_per_orbit`; the doc showed `async` calls with other field
  names. `inferDimensionForBridge` takes `(bridgeId, expr)`; `evaluateMetricInverse` takes
  `(gInverse, g, inputs, tolerance?, options?)` and also returns `residualNorm`. The
  `integrateGeodesic` example used inputs that do not exist; the GL4 and `findPerihelion` entries
  had the same errors fixed in `DATAFLOW.md`.
- **`enumerateCompositions` reports no failures.** Junction and dimension refusals are skipped
  (`src/composition/enumerate.ts`); the doc promised "failures with attribution", and its example
  read a `report.candidates` field that does not exist.
- **Counts:** the catalog has 55 entries (ids 11–65), not 44 (11–54). The confrontation table had 9
  rows; the registry holds 19, and the 10 missing rows (BE-55, 56, 58–65) are added. The constants
  list gains `B_WIEN_SI`. The public-surface test counts (217 / 116 / 245) were stale — measured
  218 / 116 / 289 — and are dropped for a pointer to the test.
- **The header said** any symbol outside `EXPECTED_RUNTIME_EXPORTS` is `@internal`. The snapshot
  pins all 289 root exports, 71 of them outside that list, so the sentence contradicted the tier
  table. It now states what the test pins.
- **Subpaths that do not exist.** "Exported via `numerical/killing`" (and five others) and
  "reachable via the bridges subpath" named package subpaths that `package.json` does not export.
  They now name the defining source file, and `isActiveStatus` is stated to be unreachable.
- **History moved here from the doc:** the layers by release — connection v0.4.0, curvature v0.5.0
  (the GR-foundations release), constants v0.5.1 (`M_SUN_SI` v0.8.0, `M_E_SI` v0.11), Killing /
  field-equation / invariants v0.6.0, intelligent index v0.7.x, composition / membership / GW170817
  v0.8.0 (BE-42 reversed to a bridge in its Phase-4 adjudication), calibration edges `be12Edge`,
  `be11ZurekEdge`, `be37Edge` v0.9.0, the catalog-edge tranche v0.10.0, `CATALOG_FULL_EDGES`,
  the namespacing gate, Klein-Gordon and BE-23 v0.11, symbolic composition v0.12, geometrized
  adapters (G-9 increment 2), `BridgeEquations` and the axis-order extension v0.14, and the
  discovery / confrontation program: BE-52 × Mercury v0.28.0, the adjudication ledger v0.31.0,
  `rankDiscoveries` on the root v0.32.0, the unified registry, consequence propagation and
  sensitivity v0.33.0, BE-51 v0.35.0, the grounding ledger and BE-21 v0.37.0, BE-35 v0.38.0,
  BE-11 v0.39.0, the BE-36 one-sided `caveat` v0.40.0. The v0.9.0 Painlevé–Gullstrand
  `Float64Array` migration was breaking only for deep importers of that module. The type table's
  "Added" column (v0.1.0–v0.6.0 per type) and the confrontation table's "Added" column are
  dropped.

### ⚠ Stability promise tightened (2026-09-23) — no `@public-new` tier; those symbols are `@public`

**What changes for a consumer.** `docs/architecture/API.md` labelled about 60 exports `@public-new`,
a tier it described as "may be adjusted in a subsequent minor release". Those exports are now
documented as `@public`: **a breaking change to any of them requires a major-version bump.** This
tightens the promise; no code changed behaviour, and no consumer can break from it.

- **Why.** The source never carried the tier: `@public-new` appears 0 times in `src/` and
  `git log -S'@public-new' -- src` is empty, while 528 doc blocks say `@public`. The doc had
  published a looser contract than the code declares, and nothing enforced it. The
  `@public-new` row of the tier table and its "rolling tier" paragraph are removed.
- **Source aligned in the same commit.** 12 of those exports had no stability tag at all:
  `christoffel`, `validateKretschmannScalar`, and the types `CovariantDerivativeNode`,
  `RicciTensorNode`, `EinsteinTensorNode`, `BianchiResidualNode`, `KretschmannScalarNode`,
  `EinsteinFieldEquationNode`, `GravitationalLensingInputs`, `GravitationalLensingResult`,
  `PerihelionPrecessionInputs`, `PerihelionPrecessionResult`. Each now carries `@public`; the 10
  types also gain a one-line summary. The code-docs ratchet falls 167 → 157.
- **Who decided.** An ADR-level call made by Mothership, the lead, under the user's delegation
  (option (a) of three). No independent human reviewed it.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — `DATAFLOW.md` in Simplified Technical English, stateless

- 14 STE findings fixed (10 long sentences, 3 ambiguous references, 1 passive), prose only.
  `ste_check` reports 0 for the file. Tables, fences, diagrams, headings and the Verification
  block are byte-identical to the fact-fix commit before it, and every technical token is
  preserved, with no removals or additions.
- A Fable panel review (in-session, not human) FAILED one of 10 changes. It had moved `bin/upt.mjs`
  in front of the verb, so the appositive "a launcher that loads..." attached to `src/cli/main.ts`
  and read as false. Fixed as two sentences; the re-review PASSED all 10.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — `DATAFLOW.md` stale facts corrected against the source

A fact-fix commit, kept separate from the Simplified Technical English pass so that each commit
carries one kind of change. Every correction was measured against the current tree or `dist`:

- **Flow 5 (geodesic integration) described an API that does not exist.** The RK4 input bundle
  named `dτ` and `nSteps`; the real inputs are `tauStart`, `tauEnd`, `steps` and an optional
  `domainMinRadius`, and `christoffelFn` returns a flat `Float64Array(64)`. The result is
  `{ xFinal, vFinal, trajectory }`, with positions sampled about 100 times, not `nSteps + 1`
  `{ x, v }` records. The GL4 path does not take the RK4 shape: it works on the canonical state
  (x, p) with `gInverseFn` / `dgInverseFn` and returns `GL4Snapshot[]`. `findPerihelion` reads
  `(tau, x, p)` snapshots, so an RK4 trajectory cannot feed it. "Energy-conserving" is dropped:
  a symplectic method bounds energy drift, and the source never claims conservation.
- **Flow 3:** "no symbolic-tree differentiation" was false since `bridgeGradientAST`
  (`src/diff/bridge-ast-gradient.ts`); and `derivativeStrategy: 'computed'` lowers ∂g to zero,
  not through finite differences (`src/numerical/derivative-lowering.ts`).
- **Flow 4:** catalog ids run 11–65, not 11–54.
- **Flow 10:** the confrontation registry holds 19 entries, not 9. The doc now points to
  `listConfrontations()` instead of carrying a count that no gate holds.
- **History moved here from the doc** (it had carried it as present fact):
  - Enumeration over the 15-edge graph (v0.10.0): 6 valid, 4 registered, 2 novel. Over the
    41-edge graph (v0.11): 11 compositions, 7 novel, 1 collision held at the gate. Re-measured
    2026-09-23 on the 41-edge graph: 11 compositions, 4 registered, 7 novel, 1 requiring a
    disposition — unchanged.
  - The flow and gate labels: Flow 8 v0.8.0 → v0.11, Flow 9 v0.10.0, the alias gate v0.11
    (Option D), the adjudication overlay v0.31 (Phase 1), consequence annotation v0.33
    (Phase 4-Unit-A), the grounding ledger v0.37 (PI-instrument Phase 1), the BE-36 one-sided
    caveat v0.40, the mechanism-proxy and propose→confront assessments 2026-07-04, the atlas path
    query Sprint 2, the Kretschmann factored raising v0.11, RK4 v0.4.0, GL4 and `findPerihelion`
    v0.5.0, the curvature validators v0.5.0 / v0.6.0.
  - Before `repo_map` 0.4.2 the whole CLI was absent from the dependency graph and 28 live files
    were reported as orphans, because `bin/upt.mjs` loads `dist/cli/main.js` by a path built at
    runtime.
- Found while measuring, filed in `todo.md`: stale JSDoc in `src/numerical/gl4-integrator.ts`
  and the `findPerihelion` `@example`.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — `duplicate-symbols.md` in Simplified Technical English, stateless

- 6 STE findings fixed (3 long sentences, 3 ambiguous references); `ste_check` reports 0 for the
  file. Tables, headings and the Verification block are byte-identical, and every technical token
  is preserved, with no removals or additions.
- A Fable panel review (in-session, not human) PASSED all 7 changes, including "unusually clean"
  to "unusually low" and the two-branch disjunction recast as two conditionals.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — `FILE_INVENTORY.md` in Simplified Technical English, stateless

- 4 STE findings fixed; `ste_check` reports 0 for the file. Tables, headings and the Verification
  block are byte-identical, and every technical token is preserved except those listed below.
- **Moved out of the doc, as history:** before two `repo_map` fixes, this repository reported 50
  orphans: 28 were the whole `src/cli/` subtree, lost because the launcher's entry could not be
  resolved, and 15 were benchmarks filed under `src` because only `benchmarks/` was matched. The
  doc now states the two failure modes and how the tool avoids each. It gives no count, because
  both counts were past measurements; `src/cli/` has 31 files today and `bench/` has 16.
- A Fable panel review (in-session, not human) FAILED the first draft, which had recast 28 and 15
  as present-tense counts and dropped a causal link, and PASSED the revision.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — 40 dated architecture records are marked historical for the STE check

- Each of the 40 dated, point-in-time records under `docs/architecture/` now carries
  `<!-- ste:historical-record -->` in its first five lines. `ste_check.py` (architecture-docs 0.6.0)
  reports these files as SKIPPED, not as passes: history is not rewritten into Simplified Technical
  English. No canonical document is marked. The 10 canonical documents, and the 5 LIVING
  non-canonical documents (`PHYSICS_MAP.md`, `benchmarks.md`, both tutorials and
  `archive/README.md`), are rewritten to 0 findings in their own commits.
- The first count was 45, then 43. Reading each file's head showed 5 were living documents and not
  records; 3 archive records had no findings and were left unmarked. Exactly 40 are marked.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — the atlas's `AdjudicationVerdict` is now `MembershipVerdict`

- Two DIFFERENT unions shared the name `AdjudicationVerdict`. The atlas one
  (`'bridge' | 'not-a-bridge' | 'unadjudicated'`, `@internal`, subpath only) judges whether a
  catalog row is a bridge at all. The composition one (`'genuine' | 'decoy' | 'entailed' | 'deferred'`,
  `@public`, package root) judges an identification candidate. The atlas type is renamed
  `MembershipVerdict` in `src/atlas/derive-evidence.ts`, the atlas barrel and its test. The
  compile-time pin tying it to `BridgeVerdict` still holds.
- **No public-surface change, proven:** `src/atlas/public.ts` is byte-identical before and after
  and names neither type, and the package root still exports the composition `AdjudicationVerdict`.
  The API and atlas tests pass (62). `duplicate-symbols.md` drops the group: 2 duplicate names
  now, with 1,657 distinct names re-measured from a fresh map.

### Decided (2026-09-23) — four owner decisions on Sprint 6

- **Data licence:** the exported atlas data under `data/atlas/` is CC BY 4.0. The new
  `LICENSE-DATA` names every covered file and links to the legal code. The code, the JSON schemas,
  `data/bridge-catalog.json` and the benchmark fixtures stay MIT (`LICENSE`). `README.md` and the
  governance note §4 say which licence covers what.
- **Maintainers:** one named maintainer across all atlas families is recorded as a deliberate
  decision, not a gap (governance note §1). The held-out fluid-statics family still has none.
- **Hosted frontier LLM:** not run, out of scope, and nothing spent on it (pre-registration
  Amendment 5; ROADMAP Phase 6 deliverables). Local models stand in, and every result says they are
  weaker baselines.
- **Reviewer time:** the Phase 6 exit criterion is amended to NOT MEASURED, because there are no
  independent human reviewers. The criterion now records this instead of holding an unmet box.

### Fixed (2026-09-23) — master CI was red after PR #184

- PR #184 (0ae8cbf) added a `uniformity:` line to the `upt atlas` report on purpose
  (`formatUniformity` in `src/cli/commands/atlas.ts`), but did not update the CLI golden corpus.
  `tests/cli/upt-golden.test.ts > atlas-pendulum` failed in CI on the merge (run 35882497084;
  the only failure) and in the pre-push hook. The corpus was regenerated with
  `node tests/cli/golden-capture.mjs`. It changed exactly one line in one file,
  `tests/cli/golden/atlas-pendulum.txt`: the intended `uniformity:` line. This was a deterministic
  failure, not the open flaky test.

### Decided (2026-09-23) — the Tier 1 `atlas` namespace stays; the roadmap rule says why

- `docs/decisions/atlas-tier1-namespace.md` records the decision. Mothership decided it as lead,
  with the user's delegation for ADR-level calls; no independent human reviewed it. Tier 1 was
  promoted (07041cc) on API-quality grounds BEFORE the study ran. The study's NOT MET result on
  criterion 2 refutes a claim that Tier 1 does not expose: the benchmark runner and the
  applicability checker are `@internal`, and they are absent from `src/atlas/public.ts`.
- `ROADMAP.md` Phase 6: the promotion rule now reads that a symbol whose value depends on a
  benchmark claim waits on the study, and a symbol selected on API-quality grounds alone does not.
  The rule and the practice now agree.
- **Audit for claims that the atlas rejects invalid bridges better than alternatives:** none found
  in `README.md`, `cli/README.md`, `docs/specification/` or `docs/README.md`. `ROADMAP.md`
  named that comparison as the proposal's headline test, and it now points to the result
  (the atlas did not beat the LLM baselines) so the line cannot be read as a live thesis.

- Fixed: atlas design notes and ROADMAP.md stated rules the code no longer follows (not-a-bridge forces contradicted; types-only ablation accepts unchecked items; no LLM runner; empty frozen set; Phase 2 adds optional norm and puts path bounds in propagateUncertainty).
- Added: `ApproximationBound.uniformity`; `boundPath` refuses an unanalysed bound (`uniformity-unanalysed`) before it computes a number.
- Regenerated `docs:deps`. The uniformity edit moved `totalLinesOfCode` from 68633 to 68703 in the four generated architecture artifacts. `docs-fresh` diffs those files.

### Verified (2026-09-23) — a fresh environment reproduces every published artifact byte for byte

- A clean clone of `master` (6ec5f7f) outside the working tree ran: install (frozen lockfile), build,
  the full suite (4,659 passed), `catalog:json`, `atlas:json`, `atlas:witness-results` (18/18
  checked), `atlas:study`, `docs:deps` and `smoke`. Every one of the eight regenerated artifacts is
  BYTE-IDENTICAL to its committed blob, checked by comparing bytes with `git cat-file blob`.
- **Fixed: a clean regeneration still left the tree "modified" on Windows.** `.gitattributes`
  pinned `docs/architecture/**` to LF because tools write it, but not the other tool-written
  artifacts. With `core.autocrlf=true` they checked out as CRLF, and a generator's LF output then
  showed as a change with no content difference. `data/**`, `docs/research/atlas-study-results.md`
  and `tests/fixtures/atlas/benchmark/**` are now pinned to LF as well. Proven in the fresh clone:
  before the fix, 8 files showed modified after regeneration; after it, only the fix itself did. The
  artifacts were already deterministic, so the fix is to the checkout, not to the comparison.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — the architecture-docs gate stops checking lines of code

- `totalLinesOfCode` is no longer a gated claim in `docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md` (Mothership,
  option b). It changed on almost every edit and blocked two pushes in a row. A claim that fails
  on every push trains readers to update it without reading it. The gate now holds only claims that
  change when the STRUCTURE changes: files, exports, entry roots, orphans. The figure itself, with
  its source and date, moved to `NOTES.md`, because a dated measurement does not belong in an
  architecture doc (AGENTS.md rule 6).
- Proven both ways with temporary edits, reverted afterwards. A non-exported code edit moved lines
  of code from 135,606 to 135,609, and the gate PASSED with no docs touch-up. A new tracked source
  file FAILED it (`totalSourceFiles` 843 → 844). A first probe used exported constants and failed on
  `totalExports`; that change is structural, so the gate was right to fail it.

### Changed (2026-09-23) — the study results lead with the abstention finding; the gemma rerun is declined

- `docs/research/atlas-study-results.md` now states, NEXT TO the criterion-2 verdict, that the atlas
  abstained on 116 of 125 items. The prose items rarely state the formal fields its instruments
  check, and its one advantage (1 wrong accept against 9, 5 and 13) comes entirely from that
  abstention. The sentence is computed by `scripts/run-atlas-study.mjs` from the metrics, not typed
  into the generated file. This is a finding about the interface between natural-language claims
  and the formal apparatus, and it is the most useful thing the benchmark has produced.
- **Declined: a secondary gemma4:26b run with a larger context** (Mothership, 2026-09-23). It
  cannot change the verdict, because qwen3.8:27b is the pre-registered best with 1 error. It would
  be chosen after seeing error rates, so it could only be exploratory, and it would read as a second
  chance for the atlas. It would also hold the shared GPU for about 3.7 h. The context-budget lesson
  is recorded in `NOTES.md` as a note on how baselines are built, not as a rerun.

### Result (2026-09-22/23) — criterion 2 is NOT MET: the local LLM baselines beat the atlas by a wide margin

- Pre-registered in Amendment 4 and run as frozen. The best baseline, qwen3.8:27b (balanced
  accuracy 91.8%), rejected 51 of 61 invalid items and accepted 64 of 64 valid items. The atlas
  rejected 6 of 61. Atlas minus best-LLM rejection: **−73.8%, 95% Newcombe [−82.7%, −58.7%]**,
  McNemar exact p = 6.8e−13. The interval excludes zero on the WRONG side. gpt-oss:20b (83.1%)
  also beats the atlas. Full table: `docs/research/atlas-study-results.md`.
- **Where the atlas does better:** wrong accepts. The atlas made 1; the models made 9 (qwen),
  5 (gemma) and 13 (gpt-oss). It gets there by abstaining on 116 of 125 items, because most items
  do not state the formal fields (regime values, conventions, chains) that its instruments check.
  The abstentions are reported, not folded into accuracy.
- **Read with these limits:** the baselines are local models, and the items were written and rated
  by one model family, so an LLM judge may share the author's framing. gemma4:26b returned an
  EMPTY answer on 64 of 125 items: its reasoning filled the frozen 8,192-token context. Those
  items are scored as unanswered, and gemma's score measures that budget, not its judgement.
- Run record: every model has all 125 items recorded, with nothing dropped. qwen3.8:27b: 1 error;
  123 items re-asked after the Ollama restart that ended the first run. gemma4:26b: 64 errors, all
  empty replies. gpt-oss:20b: 0 errors. Wall time: 10,292 s, 13,333 s and 1,977 s, about 7.1 h in
  total. Spend: USD 0.

### Added (2026-09-22) — the local LLM runner and its scoring (criterion 2, Amendment 4)

- `scripts/atlas-benchmark-llm-local.mjs` runs the frozen configuration: one item per call, public
  fields only, and the model's digest checked against the config before any call. A malformed
  reply is an error, never a default. A transport failure is retried once and re-asked on resume.
  The runner flushes after every item and exits non-zero when any item errored.
- `scripts/run-atlas-study.mjs` now scores each local LLM condition, picks the pre-registered best
  baseline (highest balanced accuracy), and reports atlas vs each model with the Newcombe interval
  and McNemar p. It refuses to score a model whose run is unfinished: a missing record, or a
  transport failure the runner will retry. Checked on a partial run, where it reported 103
  unfinished items rather than scoring them as unanswered.
- The first run lost every request from item 3 onward: the llm-wiki `OllamaServe` watchdog
  restarted a healthy Ollama when the probe model was merely NOT-LOADED. Starship owns that fix.
  It exposed two runner defects, now fixed: resume skipped items that had failed on transport, and
  a failed digest check crashed the run instead of reporting.

### Fixed (2026-09-22) — a doc comment that named a parameter the function does not have

- `validateBEDimensions` (`src/bridges/equations/_be-helpers.ts`) documented `equationLabel`, but
  the parameter is `_equationLabel`: it is unused, hence the underscore. A doc that is wrong about
  a signature is worse than a missing one. The code-docs MUST count drops from 168 to 167, and the
  committed ratchet baseline is lowered to match, so the ratchet keeps its bite. Mothership found
  this in a report-only run.

### Added (2026-09-22) — pre-registration Amendment 4: criterion 2 on local LLM baselines

- Committed BEFORE any model call. The owner chose to spend nothing, so criterion 2 runs against
  local Ollama models (qwen3.8:27b, gemma4:26b, gpt-oss:20b). The frozen configuration is in
  `tests/fixtures/atlas/benchmark/conditions/llm-local.config.json`: models and digests,
  temperature 0 and a fixed seed, the exact prompt, one item per call, and the public fields
  only. The "best baseline" is fixed in advance as the model with the highest balanced accuracy,
  so a model that rejects everything cannot win. Stated limit: local models are weaker baselines
  than a hosted frontier model. Criterion 3 is not run, because the set has no reference corpus
  or correct-reference labels.

### Changed (2026-09-22) — Dependabot holds the optional mathts-* peers

- `.github/dependabot.yml` ignores `@danielsimonjr/mathts-*`. The optional peers are held for a
  dedicated MathTS-alignment release (`todo.md`), not merged as drive-by bumps. Mothership closed
  Dependabot PRs #178–181 for that reason. The pattern matches all nine mathts packages in
  `package.json`. Remove the entry when the alignment release lands.

### Fixed (2026-09-22) — the architecture-docs claims now have a gate, and the stale ones are corrected

- **The architecture-docs claims had no gate that could fail.** The `docs-fresh` CI job regenerates
  only the dependency artifacts. It never runs `repo_map.py check`, so the `## Verification` tables
  in seven hand-written docs had drifted: for example 710 source files were claimed where there are
  842, and 2,377 exports where there are 2,990. The pre-push hook now runs a gate named
  "architecture-docs claims (repo_map check)", scoped to those tables. It was run RED on the
  unfixed tree first, with 19 stale claims in 7 docs. It runs in the hook and not in CI, because
  `repo_map.py` lives in a private repository that CI cannot read without a credential. That
  decision is filed in `todo.md`.
- **Also fixed in the hook: the code-docs ratchet could pass on a crash.** It read its count with
  `grep ... || echo 0`, so a crash, or a change in the tool's output, read as "0 MUST issues" and
  was reported as an improvement. It now needs a PASS or FAIL line from the tool. A crashing fake
  tool fails the hook, and a genuine PASS still passes.
- **The docs, corrected from a fresh map.** Every `## Verification` row was updated from
  `repo_map.py check` output. The prose that restates a number was corrected as well, because the
  gate reads only the tables:
  - the `src/`-scope figures are now 348 files, 2,446 exports and 1,229 re-exports, read from
    `dependency-graph.json`; the module count went from 10 to 11 with `atlas`;
  - the per-module file counts are taken from the generator;
  - the bridge count (55, IDs 11–65) and the confrontation count (19) come from the built
    registries, each counted two ways;
  - the per-zone and per-disposition inventories each sum to 842;
  - the entry roots are now 5 (the atlas and probe subpaths);
  - `duplicate-symbols.md` gained a third group. It is `AdjudicationVerdict`: two DIFFERENT unions
    under one name, one `@internal` in the atlas and one `@public` in composition. A rename is
    recommended.
- **`COMPONENTS.md` has an Atlas Module section**, with the real signatures. `ste_check.py` finds
  no problem in it; the doc's other sections still carry 33 STE findings. The remaining ungated
  prose (release versions, "Currently" counts, 691 STE findings across the architecture docs) is
  filed in `todo.md`, not claimed as fixed.

### Changed (2026-09-22) — `CLAUDE.md` is a thin loader; each of its facts moved to one home

- `CLAUDE.md` went from 20,983 bytes to a 742-byte loader that `@`-imports `AGENTS.md`,
  `WORKFLOWS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `MEMORY.md` and `NOTES.md`. Each fact was MOVED, not copied:
  - the stack, source map, AST grammar, encoding patterns and invariants went to `MEMORY.md`;
  - the commands table went to `TOOLS.md`;
  - the release order, the TDD-from-a-plan gotchas and the review tier went to `WORKFLOWS.md`;
  - every count and dated measurement went to `NOTES.md`.

  A scan for facts stated in two files found five, and each now has one home.
- **Stale statements found in the move and corrected, not carried over:**
  - The atlas source-map row said nothing is re-exported from `src/index.ts`. The `atlas`
    namespace has been exported since 07041cc.
  - The import-site list missed a type-only import at `composition/compose.ts:48`; re-measured.
  - The test-suite timing now names the test count it was measured at.
- `tests/cli/command-count-prose.test.ts` read the CLI count from `CLAUDE.md`. It now reads
  `NOTES.md`, and its negative control covers that file. A mutation to 23 failed both tests.

### Changed (2026-09-22) — the active ledger leaves `docs/planning/`; the plan audit can no longer pass on nothing

- `docs/planning/ACTIVE.md` moved to the repository root as `ACTIVE.md`. It is an authorization and
  completion register, which is status by nature, and `docs/planning/` holds design only. Its
  outbound links, and every inbound link and path reference, were fixed in the same commit:
  `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, the Atlas design notes, the Scientific-Bridge-Discovery notes and
  `tools/plan-doc-audit`. The `todo.md` rows that record where a sprint WAS promoted keep the old
  path, because that is history.
- **Fixed: a missing plan root made the `audit:plans` release gate pass having scanned nothing.**
  `collectMd` returned `[]` for a path that did not exist, so moving the ledger without updating the
  default would have silently disabled the gate. A missing root is now an error, and the default
  lives in an exported `DEFAULT_PLAN_ROOTS`. `tests/tools/plan-doc-audit.test.ts` pins that every
  default root exists and that a missing root throws. It failed 2 of 3 before the fix. The audit
  scans the same 4 unchecked items from the new location as it did from the old one.

### Fixed (2026-09-22) — the public benchmark file no longer carries the answer

- `BenchmarkItem` carried `kind` and `failureKind`, which are the answer, even though its own
  docstring said "never the answer". The atlas condition never read them, but any LLM or embedding
  condition fed `public/items.json` would have read the key. Both fields now live only in
  `scorer/labels.json`. The loader refuses a public or contested item that carries either field.
  The kind rules moved to a new `validateLabels`, which checks the answer key against the set:
  one label per item, none for an unknown item, and a known failure kind exactly on invalid
  labels. The assembly and study scripts run it, and the study exits 4 when the key does not fit.
- The items, labels, freeze and every count are unchanged, and a rerun of the study produced a
  byte-identical results file. Only the frozen-set hash moved, recorded in pre-registration
  Amendment 3. The tests were written first and failed 5 of 5 before the fix.

### Changed (2026-09-22) — status moved out of the design documents; the repo gains its control files

- **The Atlas planning documents now state design only.** MET/UNMET/OPEN markers, progress counts,
  dates and "today" wording were removed from `Atlas-Phase-{0,4,5,6}-Design.md`,
  `Atlas-API-Review.md`, `Atlas-Governance.md`, `Atlas-Phase-0-Curation-Cost.md` and
  `Atlas-Roadmap-Implementation-Plan.md`. Each document keeps its intent, the criteria as
  DEFINED, and the reasoning. The status moved to `NOTES.md`. The history was already in this
  CHANGELOG, so it was deleted there rather than copied. The exit-criteria table in Phase 4 now
  says how each criterion is CHECKED, not whether it is met.
- **Three design statements had gone false, and nothing had flagged them:**
  - Phase 4 still said 12 of the 18 witnesses lacked a negative control.
  - Phase 6 still said the study path had never run.
  - The API review still said no atlas symbol was `@public`.

  That silent staleness is why status does not belong in a design document.
- **New root files:** `AGENTS.md` (the law), `WORKFLOWS.md` (procedure), `TOOLS.md` (instruments,
  and how each one misleads), `MEMORY.md` (stateless facts) and `NOTES.md` (dated state). Mothership
  drafted them. They were corrected before commit:
  - AGENTS.md said no agent may author a frozen item. That contradicts the owner's rule allowing
    atlas-blind model authors.
  - Status was routed to a `status.md` that is outside the repository.
  - NOTES.md was already stale on kappa and on the study run.
  - Several facts appeared in two or three of the files.
- `CLAUDE.md` still duplicates facts that now have a home in those files. That move is filed in
  `todo.md`.

### Added (2026-09-22) — the benchmark set exists: model-authored, model-rated, and run once

- **125 frozen items and 3 contested**, written and rated by `claude-fable-5-1` instances
  (pre-registration Amendment 2). The owner removed the human requirement. No human authored or
  rated an item.
- **The instances were isolated by how they were launched.** Each role ran as a separate `claude -p`
  process with no tools, no MCP servers, no settings, no memory, and a working directory outside the
  repository. The launch's own `init` record (`tools: []`, `mcp_servers: []`) is stored with the
  exact prompt and reply of all 32 calls in `tests/fixtures/atlas/benchmark/provenance/`, and the
  pipeline refuses a reply whose record shows a tool.
  - The author was atlas-blind.
  - The encoder never saw the answers.
  - The two raters shared no context.
  - This session has read `src/atlas/`, so it authored, encoded and rated nothing.
  Scripts: `scripts/atlas-benchmark-models.mjs` and `scripts/atlas-benchmark-assemble.mjs`.
- **Kappa between the two MODEL raters, over all 128 items and before the freeze:** 0.984
  (valid/invalid) and 0.978 (nine categories). All three roles are the same model, so this is
  model self-agreement and not evidence of human agreement.
  `tests/atlas/benchmark-model-set.test.ts` recomputes kappa and the freeze from the raw rater
  files. A control shows that one flipped verdict moves kappa.
- **The freeze took:** the empty-set hash test and the "EMPTY" fixture test both went RED on the new
  set before the note was amended. The pre-registration test now checks the LAST recorded hash, and
  its control drops one item.
- **First run of the study path on a non-empty set.** The atlas rejects 6 of 61 invalid items
  (Wilson 95% [4.6%, 19.8%]) and names the right failure kind for all 6. It abstains on 116 of 125
  items, wrongly accepts 1, and falsely rejects 1. The false reject comes from the encoding: a
  derivative with respect to ln p was encoded as a literal `ln(p)`. No LLM or embedding condition
  exists, so no paired comparison was made.
- Model cost for the whole set: USD 19.34 (author 10.78, encoder 5.45, raters 3.11). This is model
  cost, not human curation time.

### Fixed (2026-09-22) — two defects the first real run exposed

- **The dimensional validator rejected every equation of the form "x = 0".** Numbers are
  dimensionless symbols in this grammar, so "x = 0" is written `x - 0`, and the validator treated
  the literal zero as a dimensionless term. Zero is the additive identity: a dimensionless literal
  zero in a sum is now skipped. Controls: a non-zero number is still rejected, a zero does not hide
  a mismatch between the other terms, and a zero that carries a dimension is an ordinary term. On
  the benchmark this removed 4 false rejects of valid items. It also removed 2 rejections of
  invalid items that had been correct only by accident, through the same bug.
- **The atlas condition accepted an item that no instrument checked.** In the "types only"
  ablation, every item without a claimed chain was accepted, with nothing run: 61 wrong accepts.
  An accept now needs at least one instrument that ran. Otherwise the item abstains.

### Added (2026-09-22) — Newcombe's paired interval checked against the PUBLISHED table

- `tests/atlas/benchmark-stats.test.ts` now checks `pairedDifferenceInterval` against all 18 rows of
  Newcombe (1998), Statistics in Medicine 17:2635–2650, Table III, method 10. Before this change it
  was pinned by properties only.
- Result: 17 rows match to half a unit in the fourth decimal (worst error 4.9e-5). The row
  e/f/g/h = 1/97/1/1 matches to one unit, and the difference comes from the table itself: there
  e·h ≤ f·g, so by the paper's definition method 10 equals method 8. The table prints 0.8737 for
  method 8 and 0.8736 for method 10. The computed value is 0.873672. That row is held to one unit,
  and no other row is.
- Two controls show that the check can fail. First, on the 10 rows where the table separates
  method 8 from method 10, the result does NOT match method 8. Second, z for 90% instead of 95%
  fails every row that has a non-degenerate interval.
- Mutation check: with the continuity correction on φ removed, 11 of the new tests fail. The four
  older property tests all still passed under that mutant, so they alone could not detect this
  defect. The implementation was not changed.

### Added (2026-09-22) — negative controls for the 12 witnesses that had none

- `tests/atlas/negative-controls.test.ts`: one control per witness for WD1, WS2, WS4, WD6, WD7, WD8,
  WS5, WS6, WS7 (numeric) and W2s, WD2s, WD5s (CAS). Every registered witness now has a negative
  control: numeric 14/14, CAS 4/4. This closes the gap that the correction below retracts.
- Each control changes ONE field of the registered spec to a physically plausible wrong hypothesis.
  Examples: a doubled D (WD1), the fast telegraph root (WD6), a uniform steady state (WD8), √(Fμ)
  (WS7), and b ↦ 1/R (W2s). The real runner then runs the spec. Each control has a META-CHECK that
  the true spec checks, so the assertion can fail.
- Measured: every numeric wrong hypothesis is `refuted` (for example WD8 fine error 1.5, ratio 1.00,
  against tolerance 0.025). Every CAS wrong dictionary is `unresolved`, not `refuted`, because the
  simplifier cannot reduce lhs − rhs to zero. The CAS controls therefore assert "not checked".
- A coverage test pins that the 12 controls here plus the 6 existing ones equal the registry.
- `heatSteadyDeviation` takes an optional `reference` profile, so the WD8 control can measure against
  a wrong steady state. The default (the linear Laplace profile) is unchanged.

### Corrections (2026-09-22) — claims made earlier in this log that the evidence did not support

Found by auditing the session's own status record against the repository. The original sentences
are left in place, struck through or annotated, so a reader can see both that each claim was made
and that it was retracted.

- **RETRACTED: "every numeric witness has a negative control"** (S4.4 entry below, and repeated in
  `Atlas-Phase-4-Design.md` §4). It was FALSE. Counted from `WITNESS_REGISTRY`: of the **14 registered numeric witnesses, 5 have a
  negative control** (WD2, WD3, WD4, WS1, WS3). **The 9 without one are WD1, WS2, WS4, WD6, WD7, WD8,
  WS5, WS6, WS7.** Of the **4 CAS witnesses, 1 has one** (W1s); W2s, WD2s and WD5s do not. In all,
  12 of the 18 registered witnesses lack a negative control. (A first draft of this correction said
  "6 of 17": it counted WD5, which is not a registered witness, and mixed the CAS witness W1s into
  the numeric count. The figures here are counted from the registry.) The missing controls are not
  written in this change; they are filed in `todo.md` and follow in their own commit.
- **SCOPE CORRECTED: "no other bridge has a real checked counterpart"** (S4.6). True of the 12 bridges
  that existed at S4.6. The 8 Sprint 4 closure bridges were never searched then. Searched since by
  keyword against the same Physlib tree (1,327 paths at 5ad56e2): no counterpart. The one near-miss,
  `FluidDynamics/CauchyFlow/NavierStokes.lean`, was READ: it defines the equations and proves only
  that the conservative and convective forms are equivalent. Nothing on creeping flow, a sphere or
  drag, so it is not a counterpart for `ab-stokes-einstein`.
- **WEAKER THAN STATED: the S4.3 "two `test:atlas` runs leave the tree byte-identical" check.** It
  compared `git status --porcelain` while files were UNSTAGED, which cannot see a test rewriting an
  already-modified file. The ORIGINAL check did not establish what it claimed. Re-verified on a clean
  tree: empty status before, two runs, empty status after. The closure-time check (files staged) was
  valid.
- **PRECISION: the S6.4 QUDT probe checked NAMES, not the stored IRIs.** It fetched `https://…/<Name>`;
  the table stores `http://…`. Re-probed with the stored strings: all 19 answer 302 → 200 (a
  fabricated name ends 404), so the stored IRIs now resolve by direct check.
- **LIMITATION DISCLOSED: the S5.1 held-out-scan positive control.** Its marker (`first-order`) was
  chosen AFTER it was known that `model-first-order` exists. It proves the matcher fires; it does not
  prove the original marker list would have caught the leakage. Disclosed in the pre-registration §3.

### Added

- **The public `atlas` namespace (Atlas API review, Tier 1).** `src/index.ts` gains exactly one
  line, `export * as atlas from './atlas/public.js'`, which is ADDITIVE: no existing export
  changed. `src/atlas/public.ts` is the single list of the public set, 24 names:
  - the vocabulary types;
  - `MissingHorizonError` and `MissingLipschitzError`;
  - `regimeHolds`;
  - the (K, δ) error algebra;
  - `composeRelation`, `COMPOSITION_TABLE` and `NO_COMPOSITE_CLAIM`.

  Each is tagged `@public` at its declaration. **Correction found while implementing:** the tier
  was not closed under type references. `AtlasFamily` carries the non-public `AtlasBridge[]`, so
  it moved to Tier 2, and `NoCompositeClaim` joined because `CompositionResult` names it.
  `tests/api/atlas-public-closure.test.ts` derives the count from the facade and checks closure
  for the whole class. Its controls prove it finds the AtlasFamily → AtlasBridge leak and ignores
  comment-only mentions, and it failed live when the leak was re-introduced (reverted). The
  runtime snapshot failed on the new key before it was updated. **`CLAUDE.md` corrected:** the
  repo is on TypeScript 7 (`^7.0.2`), not 6.x, and TS 7 ships no JavaScript compiler API.
- **The public-surface invariant learns namespace facades, proven to FAIL first.** The invariant
  parsed `export { … } from` and `export * from` but NOT `export * as NS from`. A namespace facade
  would have passed it while checking nothing. The parsers now live in
  `tests/api/_public-surface-parse.ts` as pure functions over source text, proven on synthetic
  input, including input they must reject. The forward invariant now adds a facade's named
  re-exports to its coverage. The new `namespace-facade-invariant.test.ts` checks the reverse:
  every symbol a facade re-exports must be `@public` where it is declared, and a wildcard inside a
  facade is refused. **Live demonstration before any export form changed, then reverted:** a facade
  re-exporting the untagged `regimeHolds` failed with `atlas.regimeHolds: not-tagged-public`, and
  `regimeHolds` tagged `@public` but absent from the facade failed with "not reachable".
- **Atlas barrel gap closed.** `src/atlas/index.ts` now exports `deriveEvidence`,
  `deriveEvidenceForVerdict`, `NO_PASSING_WITNESSES`, `ALL_EVIDENCE_TAGS`, `composeRelation`,
  `COMPOSITION_TABLE`, `NO_COMPOSITE_CLAIM`, `findPath` and `boundPath` (with their types). The S6.7
  API review found that subpath users could not reach the Phase 1–3 core at all.
  `tests/atlas/barrel-completeness.test.ts` was run FAILING (8 of 8) before the fix and passes after.
  docs:deps reports 0 circular dependencies.
- **S6.7 — the atlas API review. A RECOMMENDATION only; nothing is applied.**
  `docs/planning/Atlas-API-Review.md` sorts symbols into three tiers against three criteria:
  settled semantics, independent evidence, and no repository coupling. It found no name
  collisions (154 atlas names against 514 root names). It found a pre-existing gap: `deriveEvidence`,
  `composeRelation`, `COMPOSITION_TABLE`, `findPath`, `boundPath` and three constants are not in
  the atlas barrel at all. It recommends a namespace facade, and notes that the public-tag
  invariant test does not yet parse `export * as ns`. An adversarial review (Gemini, inlined text,
  canary-verified) showed that the first Tier 1 broke the review's own criterion 1 and
  contradicted its own coupling rule. The symbols involved moved to Tier 2, and the dispositions
  are recorded. The decision goes to Mothership, because it is ADR-level.
- **S6.6 — the atlas governance note.** `docs/planning/Atlas-Governance.md` covers maintainers, the
  contested-entry policy (a disputed record stays `proposed` and is corrected or REJECTED with a
  witness, never quietly removed or weakened), contribution by small single-claim PRs with their
  witnesses and gates, and licensing. Code is MIT. The data is under the same `LICENSE` today, and
  a separate data licence is recorded as an owner decision not taken here. The maintainer field
  was supplied by the owner. The benchmark's frozen-set authors remain TO BE NAMED.
- **S6.5 — `upt atlas [<bridge-id>]`, one bridge with every qualification visible.** Empty sections
  print `none stated`, a regime with no inequality prints `VACUOUS`, and `formally-proved` is
  shown WITH its scope (the statement only, not the bound). Eve E6's check is a test: three
  bridges have every field of their source record found in the output.
  **Defects fixed:** (1) the command-count gate counted commands from a STATIC help string, so
  `upt atlas` ran while `upt help` hid it. New `listCommandNames()` and
  `tests/cli/help-covers-registry.test.ts` compare the registry with the help. That test's first
  draft used a `` that became a backspace in a template literal and flagged every command, so
  its control now checks both directions. (2) `upt regime`, `upt path` and `findPath` searched
  the oscillator family only. They now use every registered family, and `upt path` refuses a
  cross-family pair with a stated reason. CLI count 21 → 22 in `CLAUDE.md` and `cli/README.md`.
  The help golden is regenerated; 16 other goldens showed line-ending churn only, verified
  content-identical and not committed as changes.
- **S6.4 — the versioned export.** `bun run atlas:json` now also writes `data/atlas/atlas.json`,
  every family under one stamp (schema stays v0, since `formalRef` is additive), and
  `data/atlas/atlas.jsonld`, which has stable URN ids, PROV-O `wasDerivedFrom`, `dcterms:source`
  citations, and QUDT quantity kinds from the checked-in `data/atlas/qudt-resolution.json`. Every
  IRI returned HTTP 200, with probe controls of Mass → 200 and a fabricated name → 404. **10 of 54
  parameters are deliberately blank**, because no same-meaning QUDT kind exists. MassPerTime
  matches a damping coefficient's dimension but means mass flow. The table is keyed by (model,
  parameter), because `kappa` means a spring constant in one model and a thermal conductivity in
  another. The export throws on a parameter with no entry. 10 tests.
- **S6.3 — link prediction, whose one result does NOT support the hypothesis.**
  `src/atlas/link-prediction.ts` runs leave-one-bridge-out over the 24-model typed graph. The typed
  predictor (common neighbours) is compared with a word-overlap baseline. Over 20 trials, recall@10
  is 0.70 against 0.80, the paired Newcombe difference −0.10 spans zero, and the MRR is 0.28
  against 0.42. Both sit only modestly above a chance level of 0.456. Two pairs that stay connected
  through another bridge are excluded and counted, and the chance level and MRR are reported
  because bare recall@10 on about 20 candidates reads as success. `docs/research/atlas-link-
  prediction.md` is bound to `tests/atlas/link-prediction.test.ts`, which recomputes every figure;
  its first run caught a minus-sign mismatch between note and code. A guard with a positive
  control pins that nothing in `src/atlas/` imports Product A's `discovery.ts`. New
  `Atlas-Phase-6-Design.md` records that the study's success path has never run.
- **S6.2 — the ablation.** `ABLATION_CONFIGS` defines four cumulative configurations of the atlas
  runner (types only, + assumptions, + dimensions & conventions, + regimes). Applicability
  findings are split by instrument. `scoreAblation` pairs each row against the one before it on
  the same invalid items. The study script emits the ablation table. **Defect avoided:**
  `items.map(runAtlasOnItem)` would have passed the array index as the new config parameter. It
  is now an explicit lambda, pinned by a test. 4 tests.
- **S6.1 — study orchestration, which REFUSES to run on nothing.** `scripts/run-atlas-study.mjs`
  (`bun run atlas:study`) and `src/atlas/benchmark/study.ts` (`scoreCondition`,
  `pairedRejection`). On the committed empty frozen set the script exits 3 and writes no results
  file (measured). A table from zero items would read like a measurement. Unanswered items count
  as wrong, never dropped. Wrong accepts, abstentions and non-answers are separate columns. Out-of-
  process conditions are not scored, because no worker exists yet, and the output says so.
  Sprint 6 is promoted. 6 tests.
- **S5.5 — the benchmark pre-registration, REGISTERED before any condition runs.**
  `docs/research/atlas-benchmark-preregistration.md` freezes the six criteria, the held-out
  family (fluid statics), the conditions, the even sampling of failure kinds, and the power
  statement. It records the SHA-256 of the frozen item set. That set is EMPTY, and the hash
  `4f53cda1…` equals `sha256("[]")`, checked a second way with `sha256sum`.
  `tests/atlas/benchmark-preregistration.test.ts` recomputes the hash from the committed items,
  with a positive control, so the set cannot change without an amendment. **Raters and items are
  "TO BE NAMED"**: no agent may author a frozen item, so Phase 5's "κ reported" criterion waits on
  independent people.
- **S5.4 — the statistics and the power report.** `src/atlas/benchmark/stats.ts` provides the
  Wilson interval, McNemar (continuity χ² and exact binomial p), Cohen's κ, the Newcombe method-10
  paired-difference interval, and `powerReport`. Each value was checked against a number computed
  independently: the plan's Wilson values, a hand-computed McNemar table (49/12, 158/4096), and a
  hand-computed κ = 0.4. Newcombe has no textbook value in the repository, so it is pinned by
  properties (antisymmetry, reduction to square-and-add at φ = 0), and a published-example check
  is recorded as open. At 0.8 accuracy, 60 items per class give ±10.0 points and 200 give ±5.5.
  14 tests.
- **S5.3 — the deterministic baselines and recall@k.** `src/atlas/benchmark/baselines.ts` ranks by
  text overlap, by symbol overlap, or by typed structure (dimension-renamed normal form), with
  ties broken on id so reruns cannot reorder across the depth cut. `recallAtK` counts an
  unranked query as a miss, and throws on an answer key with no correct reference.
  `backend-shapes.ts` defines the out-of-process embeddings/LLM request and response shapes,
  with a strict parser: a malformed answer is an error, never a default `abstain`. 11 tests.
- **S5.2 — the atlas condition runner.** `src/atlas/benchmark/run-atlas.ts` applies the
  applicability checker, the composition table and the regime check to each item. It emits
  `accept`, `reject` or `abstain`, with the failure kind the firing rule maps to. **Accept is the
  hardest outcome to reach:** it requires every instrument to have RUN and CLEARED. A missing
  field, an empty regime, an unchecked inequality or a `question` finding abstains, because "no
  rule fired" is weaker than "valid". Composition is strength-aware. Exact ∘ exact claimed as a
  derivation clears. A chain overclaimed as an exact equivalence rejects: `omitted-premise`
  through a restriction, otherwise `false-inverse`. The item schema gains the OPTIONAL machine
  fields those checks read. 14 tests.
- **S5.1 — the benchmark item schema, loader and leakage checks, plus two corrections to the
  plan.** `src/atlas/benchmark/{types,leakage,loader}.ts`, `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-5-Design.md`
  (L5.1), and `tests/fixtures/atlas/benchmark/{public,scorer,contested}/`, which are all
  **EMPTY on purpose**: no agent may author a frozen item, and the loader refuses any frozen item
  whose authorship is not `'independent'`. An import guard with a positive control keeps every
  `src/` file out of the answer half. **Correction 1: `normalForm` is NAME-sensitive**
  (`x/t` ≠ `y/s`, measured), so it cannot detect renamed variants as briefed. `leakageKey` renames
  dimensioned symbols by dimension first. That over-merges, which is the safe direction for
  leakage. **Correction 2: the held-out family.** The plan's "first-order relaxation" is ALREADY
  ENCODED in Phase 0 as `model-first-order` (b x′ + k x = 0). The held-out family is now **fluid
  statics**, which has zero footprint in `src/atlas/`. The absence scan carries a positive control
  that finds `model-first-order` under the original family's marker. Sprint 5 is promoted in
  `ACTIVE.md`. Phase 4 is recorded as delivered, with "≥ 5 reviewed `formalRef`" OPEN at 1 of 5
  beside the MET 20-bridge criterion.
- **Sprint 4 closure: 20 bridges, the exit criterion MET with nothing cut.** Eight witnessed
  bridges were added: `ab-langevin-diffusion` (Einstein D = k_BT/γ, from the Langevin moment
  equations), `ab-stokes-einstein` (a hyperedge; CAS plus agreement with CE-stokes-einstein up
  to its deliberately omitted 6π), `ab-telegraph-diffusion` (a SINGULAR limit whose machine
  horizon has a lower edge at the initial layer), `ab-telegraph-wave`, `ab-heat-laplace`
  (steady state), `ab-kg-schrodinger` (non-relativistic limit, crossing into the diffusion
  family), `ab-kg-oscillator` (uniform-mode restriction) and `ab-stiff-string` (the flexible
  limit). There are five new models. All 18 registered witnesses CHECK, and their convergence
  ratios match their orders (≈2 first-order, ≈4 second-order, ≈10 per decade).
  `tests/atlas/closure.test.ts` pins every edge `delta` as exact and every error function as
  monotone on its domain. The Phase 0 pilot is untouched (`oscillators.json` byte-identical).
  **Exit tally:** 20 bridges and 6 types MET; `formally-proved` only derived MET; curation cost
  recorded; **"≥ 5 reviewed `formalRef`" OPEN at 1**, escalated because closing it needs an
  out-of-tree proof repository.
- **S4.6 — formal references: ONE, not five, and the honesty rule held.** `ab-pendulum-linear`
  now carries a `formalRef` to Physlib's
  `ClassicalMechanics.SimplePendulum.linearizedEquationOfMotion_iff` (the linearized pendulum is
  the harmonic oscillator with ω0² = g/ℓ) at `physlib@5ad56e2` / Lean `v4.34.0`, with
  `fidelity: 'sanity-lemmas'` earned in `tests/atlas/formal-sanity.test.ts`. The axioms
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` were MEASURED with `#print axioms` on a local Lean
  build. A positive control (a deliberate `sorry` prints `sorryAx`) shows the probe can report a
  hole. No other bridge has a real checked counterpart **[scope corrected 2026-09-22: of the 12
  bridges that existed at S4.6 — see "Corrections"]**. `planeWave_waveEquation` proves only the
  converse of the d'Alembert bridge. The design note records the search and the per-bridge
  verdicts. The serializer now emits `formalRef`, and `data/atlas/oscillators.json` shows it.
- **S4.5 — the wave family.** `src/atlas/waves/` defines six models and four bridges:
  `ab-string-wave` (restriction, c² = F/μ), `ab-wave-dalembert` (derivation), `ab-sound-speed`
  (derivation, a two-premise HYPEREDGE from linearized Euler plus the adiabatic EOS), and
  `ab-klein-gordon-wave` (approximation, the dispersion-free limit, with an exact-edge `delta` and
  a π/2-drift machine horizon). Witnesses WS1 to WS4 converge at second order (ratio ≈ 4). WS3
  steps the Euler pair and reaches the pressure ONLY through the EOS slope, so both premises
  are exercised. WS3b records Newton's isothermal 290.10 m/s against Laplace's 343.25 m/s for air.
  `model-wave-1d` is reused, not redefined. `tests/atlas/families.test.ts` pins unique ids,
  cross-family endpoint resolution, and ≥ 5 relation types (six are present).
  **The ≥ 20-bridge exit criterion is OPEN at 12 and is NOT recorded as a cut:** the measured
  cost (about 6 minutes per bridge) makes 20 reachable. The shortfall is that the plan's briefs
  name only 12 bridges.
- **S4.4 — the diffusion family.** `src/atlas/diffusion/` defines four models (random walk, Fick,
  heat, free Schrödinger) and three bridges of three relation types: `ab-walk-diffusion`
  (coarse-graining, closure D = Δx²/(2Δt)), `ab-heat-diffusion` (exact equivalence,
  κ/(ρc_p) ↦ D), and `ab-schrodinger-diffusion` (analytic continuation, t = −iτ, reusing W5).
  Numeric witnesses WD1, WD2 and WD3 run at two resolutions into
  `data/atlas/witness-results.json` with their convergence ratios (9.99, 4.00, 16.1). WD2s is a
  CAS check of the decay-rate dictionary. WD1b and WD3b witness what each bridge discards: the
  walk's light cone, and unitarity. Every tolerance was set after measurement. ~~and every numeric
  witness has a negative control~~ **[RETRACTED 2026-09-22: false — 5 of the 14 registered numeric
  witnesses have one; see the "Corrections" entry at the top of Unreleased.]** The Fourier number is derived. Péclet is stated as NOT
  APPLICABLE, because no model has advection, and no group is invented for it.
  **Whole-atlas gates now iterate `ATLAS_FAMILIES`**: the evidence rule, admission, and
  `bun run atlas:json`, which now writes one artifact per family (`data/atlas/diffusion.json`
  is new, and `oscillators.json` is reproduced byte-for-byte).
- **S4.3 — `formalRef`, the witness-results artifact, and the two derived tags.**
  `FormalRef` / `FormalFidelity` in `src/atlas/types.ts` and optional `AtlasBridge.formalRef`.
  `formally-proved` is derived iff `formalRef.fidelity !== 'unreviewed'`, so an unreviewed
  reference is recordable but can never earn the tag. `symbolically-checked` is derived from
  `data/atlas/witness-results.json`, which is written by the Lead-run `bun run
  atlas:witness-results` (`scripts/emit-witness-results.mjs`) and pinned by
  `tests/atlas/witness-results.test.ts` with a deep-equal against a fresh run. **No test writes
  it.** The artifact's first two witnesses, `W1s` and `W2s`, push the premise model's
  expression through the bridge's dictionary and make the CAS reduce the difference to zero.
  Both CHECK, and a wrong dictionary does not. The emitter refuses to run without the CAS peer.
  `tests/atlas/derived-tag-literals.test.ts` allows the two tag literals under `src/atlas/` in
  `types.ts` and `derive-evidence.ts` only. It is a file allow-list, comments are stripped, and
  every quote style is matched. **Visible consequence:** `ab-spring-lc` no longer STORES
  `symbolically-checked`, so `data/atlas/oscillators.json` drops it from that record. The tag
  is now earned through the artifact, and `ab-damped-rlc` earns it for the first time.
- **S4.2 — the witness runners.** `src/atlas/witness-result.ts`, `witness-symbolic.ts`,
  `witness-numeric.ts`. `runSymbolicWitness` simplifies `lhs − rhs` through an INJECTED
  simplifier: `null` is the absent peer, a stub is the present one, and no test touches the
  formula registry (it has no reset hook). `runNumericWitness` evaluates at two resolutions and
  records `convergence: { coarse, fine, ratio }`; the ratio is REPORTED, never compared against
  an order nobody recorded. **A check that did not run is not a check that failed:** peer
  absent, timeout, a throw and an irreducible difference are all `unresolved` with a required
  `reason`, and `refuted` is reserved for a check that completed and disagreed. A fine value
  inside tolerance whose error did NOT shrink with refinement is `unresolved/no-convergence`,
  not `checked`. `passingWitnessIds` admits only `checked`, so an unresolved run cannot earn a
  tag one layer up. Deviation from the plan, recorded in the design note: the default
  capability is `simplifyExpr`, not `getFormulaParser()`, because a parser cannot decide
  `lhs − rhs = 0`.
- **Sprint 4 promoted, and S4.1 — the applicability checker.**
  `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-4-Design.md` (L4.1) and `src/atlas/applicability.ts`.
  `checkApplicability` returns FINDINGS, never a boolean: **a boolean would have to choose
  between "unchecked" and "wrong", and those are the two states the module exists to keep
  apart.** Each finding is `'blocking'` when the data CONTRADICTS itself (dimensional failure,
  declared convention mismatch, literal zero divisor) or `'question'` when it is SILENT (an
  unguarded divisor, a one-sided convention declaration, an unrecorded cross-family step) —
  the same asymmetry `conventions.ts` already argues for, applied to every rule.
  **The division rule's shallow prose matcher is a STATED limit with the asymmetry the right
  way round:** it can produce a false QUESTION (a real guard phrased in unknown words) but not
  a false CLEARANCE, because a divisor absent from the prose cannot match any marker. A test
  pins that a guard on a different symbol does not clear the divisor.
  **The squaring rule fires only on two terms raised to the SAME even power**, not on an
  isolated square: `ExprNode` has no equation node, so `x² = y²` is representable only as the
  difference, and an even power alone is not a solution-adding step. A rule that fired on every
  square would report on nearly every record in the atlas and be switched off within a week.
  **An empty result means "no rule fired", which is weaker than "valid"** — pinned by a test
  that gives the checker nothing at all and still gets `[]`.

- **Sprint 3 Wave 2 — the poster index, its typed edges, and `upt map --source=poster`.**
  `src/atlas/poster/{statements,derivations,associations}.ts`, `src/composition/poster-source.ts`,
  four new L1 canonical entries (103 → 107), and the poster viz source with its hidden-node check.
  **The sixteen entries were DERIVED, never invented.** Blueprint v2 Appendix A — which maps entry
  number to name — is not in this repo. `ROADMAP.md` Phase 3 states all fifteen typed edges with
  their assumptions and the five hidden nodes, so each entry was pinned from the edge text.
  **Two agents derived them independently and agreed**, which is the strongest evidence available
  without the source document: 1 first law, 2 Boltzmann entropy, 4 uncertainty, 5 E=mc², 6
  Schrödinger, 8 Einstein field equations, 9–11 Newton I–III, 12 universal gravitation, 13 normal
  distribution, 15 superposition, 16 special relativity. **7 is PARTIAL** (a single Maxwell
  equation; which one is not recoverable, and the full system is a separate hidden node) and
  **3 and 14 are UNIDENTIFIED** — named only as "association only" anywhere in the tree. They are
  recorded as unidentified rather than guessed: an invented entry would be plausible and
  uncheckable, which is the one failure mode that survives review.
  **The `ast` guard is real and its test proves it fires.** `statements.ts` refuses any poster
  statement carrying an `ast` — *"poster statements are named and linked, never evaluated"* — and
  the test deliberately constructs an invalid node to watch it throw. That fixture needs
  `as unknown as`, which is the POINT rather than a workaround: a single-step cast does not
  compile because the types do not overlap, and narrowing the fixture to a valid node would test
  nothing.
  **`Association` requires a `citation`**, so an association records WHERE its shared constant,
  symbol or historical link comes from rather than asserting it unsourced. The real associations
  cite `ROADMAP.md § Phase 3`.
  **Adam A3 findings applied:** `2 → 13` gains the MaxEnt fixed-mean-and-variance constraint;
  `16 → 5, 10` states `v/c << 1` explicitly rather than leaving it implied. **`8 → 12` is
  recorded as DIRECTION UNRESOLVED** — the review argued the arrow is backwards, but that depends
  on an entry identification nobody can verify without Appendix A, so it is neither "fixed" nor
  filed as a defect.
  Measured: 4326 tests passing across 409 files, both typechecks clean (`tsc` and
  `tsc -p tsconfig.tests.json`), `docs:deps` 0 circular dependencies.

- **`ROADMAP.md`'s phase-status table now reflects measured reality.** All seven rows read
  "not started" while Phases 0–2 had shipped and Phase 3 was under way. A stale status table is
  worse than no status table: it answers "what is left?" confidently and wrongly, and it is the
  one document a reader consults before deciding whether to proceed or ask.
  **The mitigation was already written three lines above the table.** The risk register's last row
  names this exact failure — *"this document drifts like the old `CLAUDE.md` release section
  did"* — and prescribes the remedy: a one-line status pointer when a phase ships, never a
  narrative. It was written and then never applied. Added a standing note that the table is
  updated at the END of every sprint, citing the risk register as the reason, so the cadence is
  stated rather than inferred.
  **Nothing pins this table** — no test reads it — so it stays intent rather than enforcement.
  Recorded here rather than implied to be safe.

- **Sprint 3 Wave 1 — the `Model` record, `Statement`, `Derivation` and multicategory composition.**
  `src/atlas/model.ts` promotes `AtlasModel`; `src/atlas/statement.ts` and `src/atlas/derivation.ts`
  are new; `CanonicalEquation` gains `model?`. All `@internal`, off `src/index.ts`, reachable only
  through the `universal-physics-tensor/atlas` subpath.
  **`boundaryData` and `initialData` are OPTIONAL, against the implementation plan's wording**,
  which marks only `symmetryGroup` optional. No boundary or initial data is recorded for the nine
  ODE models, so a required field would force either fabricated values or empty ones asserting
  "there are none" — and `models.ts:5-10` already refuses that exact fabrication for
  `inequalities`. An absent field says "not recorded"; a present empty one makes a claim.
  **The refusal is a RESULT, not an exception** — and this corrected the dispatch brief. The brief
  and the roadmap line both said "throws"; design note §2 says the refusal is the correct OUTPUT,
  mirroring `boundPath`'s no-claim. `composeDerivations` returns a discriminated union
  (`kind: 'composite' | 'no-composite'` with a `reason`), with a strict `*OrThrow` wrapper so the
  brief's throw contract stays testable. A caller cannot read a conclusion off a union that was
  never formed.
  **The serializer trap held:** `serialize.ts` still enumerates model fields EXPLICITLY rather than
  spreading, so the new optional fields stay invisible to JSON — `data/atlas/oscillators.json` is
  byte-identical and `tests/atlas/atlas-json.test.ts`'s deep-equal is untouched.
  **ELEVEN MUTATION PROOFS, and one of them found a real gap.** Every guard was broken in turn and
  the suite confirmed RED before reverting: convention gate (3 failures), assumptions gate (2),
  gauge/frame gate (5), empty-list and unknown-id (1 each), input-states-no-claim (1), consumption
  gate (2), composition-table gate (1), composite context-union (2), internal-conclusion removal
  (2). **M11 — taking the union over `involved` rather than `premises` — SURVIVED**, meaning no
  test distinguished the two; a test was added and the mutation now fails. A guard nobody has
  watched fail is not a guard.
  Measured: build clean, 4266 tests passing across 407 files, `docs:deps` 0 circular dependencies,
  `tests/cli/golden/confront.txt` untouched, and no file under `src/bridges/` or
  `src/composition/` imports `src/atlas/index.ts`.

- **The canonical-entry count is now gated against the live registry** (`tests/canonical/canonical-count-prose.test.ts`).
  Sprint 3 adds L1 entries, which moves this number, and measuring first showed the scale of the
  exposure. MEASURED: the registry holds 103. The Sprint 3 plan states the count "lives only in
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and the architecture docs" — three locations. The literal is in
  **22 files**, and the live product docs the plan did not name include `README.md`, `todo.md`,
  `docs/specification/Part-V.md` and three files under `docs/research/`. Adding one entry would
  leave at least seven live prose statements stale with every test still green.
  **This is the third time in this repo** that a number restated in several places arrived with an
  INCOMPLETE list of the places — the CLI command count was in four, two of which disagreed with
  each other by four. The recurring defect is not the stale number; it is trusting a
  hand-maintained list of where a number lives. So the test DISCOVERS every product doc stating
  the count rather than enumerating them, and a file added later is covered without anyone
  remembering. History is deliberately excluded: a release note recording 103 at v0.40.0 stays
  true forever, and rewriting it would be the drift rather than the fix.
  Carries three guards, because a gate nobody has watched fire is not a gate — a vacuity guard
  asserting the patterns match the real count in real files, a negative control proving the
  matcher is sensitive to the NUMBER and not merely the words, and a registry-size floor.
  **Proven to bite:** changing `README.md`'s "103 canonical equations" to 102 failed the test
  with the file, the text and the registry value named; restored and `git diff` clean. `README.md`
  is one of the files the plan's list omitted.

- **`Float64ReferenceEngine.transpose` rewritten as an explicit odometer loop** (PR #182, Jules bot).
  Replaces the `forEachIndex` closure with a `for` loop that hoists both index arrays out of the
  traversal, so no `new Array` allocation happens per element. `out[n]` is used directly in place of
  `out[flatIndex(outIdx, outStrides)]`, which is valid because a row-major odometer's flat index IS
  the counter. Correctness was verified by DEFECT INJECTION rather than by reading the diff: a
  rank-3-only fault makes `labeled-tensor-axis-order.test.ts` fail and pass again on restore, because
  `engine-conformance.ts:68` covers only a rank-2 DEFAULT permutation and would pass vacuously.
  **The performance claim in the PR title is NOT certified** - it is plausible from the diff and was
  never measured; a contended box previously turned a 1.14x reading into 1.87x, and a number produced
  under load is worse than no number.

- **Sprint 2 lead wrap.** `DATAFLOW.md` gains Flow 13 (Atlas Path Query), documenting the three
  gates of `boundPath` and, more importantly, WHAT THE FLOW REFUSES: a `no-claim` carries no number
  BY TYPE, because the composed number would often be unchanged — composing with the identity is
  arithmetically a no-op — so a path mixing a normed approximation with an unnormed exact
  equivalence yields the RIGHT MAGNITUDE ATTACHED TO THE WRONG NORM. Also records that `regimeHolds`
  is TRI-STATE and that an unsupplied coordinate is UNKNOWN, not a pass.
- **The command count is reconciled to ONE number and GATED.** It was restated in prose in FOUR
  places and all four were stale — and two of them DISAGREED WITH EACH OTHER: `cli/README.md` said
  "19 commands" in one sentence and "all 15 — every command in the tables above except `help` and
  `version`" in another, two statements of the same quantity differing by four, neither obviously
  the newer. Measured from the registry: 23 commands, 21 data-bearing. CLAUDE.md and all three
  README figures now agree with `upt --help`.
  **`tests/cli/command-count-prose.test.ts` asserts each figure against the LIVE registry**, not
  against a literal — a literal would be a fifth place to rot. Verified by NEGATIVE CONTROL:
  restoring the historical "all 15" makes it FAIL; reverting restores 2 passed.

- **`propagateUncertainty` now reports the statistical sigma and the deterministic bound
  SEPARATELY, and refuses to combine them.** It previously returned
  `sqrt(variance + bound.delta^2)`, justified by "the usual independence assumption between input
  noise and model error". INDEPENDENCE DOES NOT LICENSE QUADRATURE FOR A BIAS: `sigma` is the 1-sigma
  spread of a zero-mean random variable while `bound.delta` is a DETERMINISTIC worst-case sup-norm
  offset, so the root-sum-square treats a systematic displacement as if it averaged out and
  UNDERSTATES the envelope — worst exactly when model error dominates the noise, which is when a
  caller most needs the number to be honest. `sigma` is now the statistical spread alone and the
  result carries `delta` beside it.
  Raised INDEPENDENTLY by two reviews that did not see each other (an adversarial physics panel, and
  Eve E2) — the strongest signal this project has produced.
  Deliberately NOT collapsed into one number: that needs a coverage factor (`k*sigma + delta`,
  k about 4.47 for 95% by Chebyshev), and that choice belongs to the caller's risk posture. Baking
  one in would repeat the original error in a new costume — a defensible-looking number whose
  provenance is a convention nobody stated.
  `tests/atlas/path-bound.test.ts` previously PINNED the defect as intent under the comment
  "Quadrature, not addition"; it is rewritten to assert the new contract and carries regression pins
  in BOTH directions (not quadrature, and not silently added). Verified by a negative control:
  restoring the quadrature makes that test FAIL, reverting makes it pass.

- **`ApproximationBound.deltaAt` — a MACHINE FORM OF THE BOUND, and the two delta repairs it made
  sayable.** The type paired `horizon: string` with `horizonHolds(t, params)` but paired
  `delta: number` with only `parameterRange?: string` — prose with no checkable counterpart. An
  implementer holding a correct parameter-dependent bound therefore had NO WAY TO EXPRESS IT and had
  to freeze it at one point, which is exactly what `ab-damped-massless` did. `admitApproximation`
  now requires `deltaAt` on an approximation, mirroring the `horizonHolds` requirement, so the type
  change and the repairs land together rather than leaving a field with no consumer.
  - `ab-pendulum-linear`: delta was `0.5**2/16 = 0.0156250`, the series evaluated AT THE DOMAIN
    EDGE — and since every series term is positive the true error there necessarily exceeds it.
    Now `pendulumPeriodErrorAt({theta0: 0.5}) = 0.015852531101436806`, VIOLATED BY THE OLD VALUE by
    1.456%. Computed two independent ways that agree to ten significant figures: AGM
    (`1/AGM(1, cos(theta0/2)) - 1`) and numerical quadrature of the elliptic integral.
  - `ab-damped-massless`: delta was `2*(1+5)*1e-3 = 0.012`, the docstring formula frozen at the ONE
    fixture mass m=1e-3, while the regime admitted m < 1/4. True sup at m=0.24 is 5.19e-1, forty
    times the declared bound. The FORMULA was right all along; only the code froze it. Now the sup
    over the declared range, `3`, and the DOMAIN is narrowed to the witness normalisation b = k = 1
    — because `2(1+|v0|)m/b` with `m < 0.25b^2/k` grows with b, so no scalar bounds it for all b.
  - Each repaired bound is witnessed AT THE DOMAIN EDGE, with a NEGATIVE CONTROL asserting the old
    frozen value FAILS that same edge assertion. A test never observed failing is a comment.

- **`upt map --relation=` and `--evidence=`** (Atlas Sprint 2, S2.4). An edge lacking the overlay is
  KEPT when no filter is set and DROPPED when one is, and the legend reports the two drop reasons
  SEPARATELY - "N dropped (did not match); M dropped (no overlay metadata)" - because a silent drop
  would make an incomplete graph look complete. `evidence` is evaluated through
  `deriveEvidenceTags(beId)`, never read from a row, since evidence is derived at read time by
  design. `VizFilterStats` is exported from the barrel because it is reachable from `VizModel`, the
  public return type of `buildVizModel`; an unexported type there would make the public API
  unnameable.
  **`--relation=approximation` currently keeps ZERO edges, and that is the honest pin, not a bug.**
  The S1.5 audit covers ten rows whose relation types are `derivation`, `coarse-graining` and
  `exact-equivalence` - not one is an `approximation` - so the implementation brief's expectation of
  a non-zero count did not match what Sprint 1 landed. A zero-result test proves nothing by itself,
  so the `derivation` case is its positive control.

- **A behavioural guard in `create-dependency-graph` against a js-yaml that quotes differently.**
  `tools/create-dependency-graph/` declares its OWN `js-yaml` and `tools/**/node_modules` is
  gitignored, so a stray install there SHADOWS the copy the root lockfile pins - node resolves from
  the generator file's own directory first. It is invisible to git and differs per machine, which
  produced a state where one machine could push and another could not, each with a clean install
  and a large docs diff consisting ENTIRELY of quote characters. The guard probes the BEHAVIOUR
  rather than the version, because a version string still does not tell you what `'auto'` will do,
  and it names the nested directory in its failure message. Measured: js-yaml 5.4.2 emits
  `probe: "a: b"` (double) and 5.0.0 emits `probe: 'a: b'` (single); the committed artifact is 46
  double-quoted and 0 single-quoted, so 5.4.2 is the calibrated one. Verified by BREAKING it -
  installed 5.0.0 nested, watched the guard fire, removed it, watched it pass.

- **`upt regime <family> [--at ...]`** and **`upt path <from> <to> [--at ...]`** (Atlas Sprint 2,
  S2.3). `regime` reports each model as valid, VIOLATED (naming the failed inequality), or UNKNOWN;
  an `--at` coordinate that was never supplied is reported as unknown and is NOT a pass. `path`
  prints the bridge chain, the composed relation, the composed `(K, delta)` with its norm, and
  whether every horizon still holds; when the composition table declines to compose it prints
  `no composite claim` and exits 0, because a refusal is an answer rather than an error.
- **Regimes on the GR spine rows BE-37, BE-51 and BE-52** and their graph edges (S2.5), on the
  groups `r_s/r` and `v/c`. Every bound is the tightest GEOMETRY its own confrontation operates at:
  `r_s(M_sun)/R_sun = 4.2463e-6` at the solar limb for BE-37 and BE-51, and
  `r_s(M)/(a(1-e)) = 6.4216e-8` with `v_p/c = 1.9672e-4` at Mercury perihelion for BE-52.
  **`v/c` is deliberately ABSENT for BE-37 and BE-51**: the CASSINI and VLBI_LAMBERT_2009 records
  carry no velocity and no impact parameter, so no slow-motion bound can be derived from them, and
  an absent bound is honest where an approximated one would be a false claim.
  A first implementation set these bounds to the confrontation's 1-sigma precision on PPN gamma
  (`observed_gamma_sigma`) with the slow-motion bound as its square root. That was REJECTED as a
  category error: sigma_gamma is a property of the INSTRUMENT - how well the experiment constrained
  gamma - while `r_s/r` is a property of the FIELD. Both are dimensionless and small, so the
  substitution satisfied `regimeHolds` and turned the test suite green, and the `alias` string cited
  a real paper, so a fabricated bound read as sourced. The rejection is recorded in the source next
  to the corrected derivation so it is not retried.

- **The pre-push gate now runs the FULL test suite**, added after it passed a commit CI then
  failed. The gate covered typecheck and docs but not tests, and the manual boundary ran only
  `tests/atlas/` and `tests/composition/` while the guard that caught the defect lives in
  `tests/api/`. **A scoped boundary is a gate with a hole shaped exactly like the directories you
  did not think of.**
- **The "too slow" assumption was wrong and measuring settled it.** `CLAUDE.md` warns of "3-5 min
  cold-start on Windows" and that figure had been carried as the steady-state cost. Measured warm:
  **58s for 4,144 tests**. Affordable against a red master.

### Fixed

- **`simplifyExpr` threw on every exact cancellation of a DIMENSIONED expression.** The CAS
  returns a bare dimensionless `0` for `v − v`, and the dimension guard read that as "the
  simplified form changed dimension". A literal zero now takes the original dimension. Found by
  the S4.2 real-peer test, whose first version asserted only "not refuted" and so PASSED while
  no dimensioned witness could ever reach `checked`. Both new tests fail with the fix reverted.
- `runSymbolicWitness`'s default path reported an ABSENT peer as `not-simplified`, because
  `simplifyExpr` returns `simplified: false` for both situations. New `isSimplifierAvailable()`
  separates them, and the real-peer test now gates on the simplifier peer rather than the
  parser registry, which is a different package.

- `UncertaintyOptions` shipped tagged `@public` while unreachable from the barrel, failing
  `tests/api/public-tag-vs-index-invariant.test.ts`. Retagged `@internal`, which is what Sprint 2's
  boundary requires — nothing new reaches `src/index.ts` before Phase 6. A symbol advertised as
  public but unreachable is a promise the package cannot keep.

- **Atlas Sprint 2 Wave 1 — regimes and path bounds.** `regime?: Regime` is now an optional field
  on `BridgeEdge` and `BridgeEquationEntry`; `src/atlas/regime.ts` gains `intersectRegimes`,
  `regimeOverlap`, `uncoveredRegions` and `admitApproximation` (which throws at ADMISSION rather
  than deferring to a validator that can be skipped). `src/atlas/path-bound.ts` adds `findPath`
  and `boundPath`.
- **`regimeHolds` is TRI-STATE**, and it names what it could not check. Adam's failure case —
  a regime requiring `Re > 2000` AND `Ma < 0.3`, with a caller supplying only `Ma` — returns
  `{ok: 'unknown', unchecked: [Re]}`, **not** `true`. An earlier draft treated an absent π-group
  as "not a violation", which is a silent pass: the caller's omission of the data that would reveal
  the violation is what produced the confident hold. Absence of evidence is not evidence of
  satisfaction.
- **A path whose relations compose to `'no-composite-claim'` returns `{kind: 'no-claim'}` and NO
  number**, naming which pair refused. A composed number over an undefined composite is the most
  dangerous output this library could produce — precise-looking and unfounded.
- `boundPath` results carry an explicit `norm` (`null` when unstated), which is what makes the
  norm-relativity constraint expressible rather than assumed away.

- **A PRE-PUSH GATE, `.githooks/pre-push`, wired via `core.hooksPath`.** Every rule adopted after
  putting `master` red was a DETECTOR — check CI in the same breath as the push, read the message
  rather than the grep count. Those shortened detection from nine commits red, to two, to one, but
  **not one of them prevents the push.** The gate runs `bun run typecheck`, then regenerates
  `docs/architecture/` after `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and fails if the tree is stale.
- **Measured, because "too slow" needed a number:** typecheck 2s, install + `docs:deps` 3s,
  staleness check 1s — **~6s total**, against three incidents (`a105f885` 9 commits red,
  `501b86c`→`b05c46b` 2 commits, `8a3359b` 1 commit) that it would have stopped. There is no speed
  argument.
- **A `prepare` script wires it on install**, because `core.hooksPath` is LOCAL git config and does
  NOT travel with a clone. Without this the repo would carry the hook FILE while git never invoked
  it — a gate that exists in the tree and fires on exactly one machine, which reads as installed
  and is not. Proven by unsetting the config, running `bun install`, and watching `prepare` restore
  it. The `|| exit 0` keeps a CI install from failing where git config is unavailable.
- **code-docs is wired as a RATCHET, not a wall — measured before deciding.** It runs in 2s, so
  speed was never the objection, but it reports **171 MUST issues across 305 files**. Blocking on
  that is not a gate: every push would be refused until the whole backlog is cleared, or
  `--no-verify` typed every time — and **a gate bypassed on every push is worse than no gate**,
  because it teaches the bypass that the next real failure rides through. The ratchet fails only
  when the count RISES above `.githooks/code-docs-baseline.txt`, blocking new debt without
  demanding the backlog. The baseline lives in version control, so lowering it is a reviewed act
  and the number itself is standing pressure.
- It SKIPS rather than blocks when `code_docs.py` is absent, since that tool lives outside this
  repo and a gate failing over a missing skill would train a bypass for reasons unrelated to the
  code.
- `git push --no-verify` bypasses it deliberately: a gate nobody can skip gets disabled wholesale,
  and a skip that must be typed is visible in a way a quietly disabled hook is not.

- **Atlas Sprint 1 Wave 3 — `Association` registry, convention checking, and the ten-row overlay
  audit.** `src/atlas/association.ts` records that two records share a constant, symbol, structure
  or historical influence — seeded from the four `'decoy'` adjudications with their notes copied
  verbatim. An association asserts NO relation and is deliberately never emitted as a graph edge;
  a test pins that no association pair is also a `CATALOG_GRAPH` edge.
- `src/atlas/conventions.ts` adds `checkConventions(a, b)`, wired into `composeEdges` behind the
  Wave 2 guard and surfaced by `upt recover` as an advisory line. **`undefined` on either side is
  "unknown", never a mismatch** — absence is not disagreement, and treating it as one would
  manufacture conflicts out of missing data.
- **Ten data-confronted catalog rows now carry the overlay** (BE-11, 21, 35, 37, 48, 51, 52, 55,
  58, 59), with the five Sprint 0 oscillator bridges re-registered through `RelationContract`.
  Where a bridge has both a row and a graph edge the same `relation` is copied onto the edge, so
  row and edge cannot disagree; `be37Edge`, `be51Edge` and `be52Edge` all carry `derivation`.

### Added

- **`counterexamplesWithRejection` — the ROADMAP's "counterexample LINKED" half, finally done.**
  ROADMAP §7 Phase 1 asks for "a `RejectedBridgeAdjudication` ⇒ `contradicted` with the
  counterexample linked". The linking was the part that was missing: BE-35 cited its rejection by
  hand and earned `contradicted` honestly, while BE-28, BE-29, BE-32 and BE-40 cited nothing — and
  a special case papered over the gap by FORCING the tag onto every rejected row, manufacturing a
  refutation from nothing. All five now derive `contradicted` from a real artifact.
- **It is a projection, not a copy.** The rejection's `reason` is never duplicated into a catalog
  row; `bridges/rejected.ts` stays its single source and the caller supplies the rejection, so the
  derivation still owns no view of which ids are rejected — which is what the ROADMAP means by
  "cross-linked … rather than duplicating it".
- The dedup predicate accepts EITHER link form. My first version matched only the machine key
  `rejection:<id>` and missed BE-35's hand-written prose reference, appending the same argument a
  second time in different words — precisely the duplication being avoided.

### Changed

- **`unknownConventionKeys` added, because an empty mismatch list was saying two different
  things.** `checkConventions` returns `[]` both when two records genuinely agree AND when one
  declares a convention the other never mentions — and a caller printing nothing leads a reader to
  infer "checked, no conflict". Eve (E1) flagged that this hides the dangerous case: A declaring
  `metricSignature: '-+++'` against a silent B is indistinguishable from agreement, though the two
  may use opposite signatures with nobody having written it down. **Silence is a question, not
  agreement.** The companion reports exactly the asymmetric keys; a key neither side declares is
  not a question and is omitted. `checkConventions` is unchanged — treating an undeclared key as a
  mismatch would manufacture conflicts out of missing data, which is the opposite error.
- **22 `// source:` comments accompany the audited values, and none cites this project's own
  documents.** Spot-checked against the physics: Kovtun–Son–Starinets 2005 PRL 94:111601 for the
  KSS bound, Shapiro 1964 PRL 13:789 for the time delay, Ghirardi–Pearle–Rimini 1990 PRA 42:78,
  Einstein 1915 Preuss. Akad. Wiss. 844. The single self-reference is a rejection citing the
  in-repo adjudication registry and is labelled as such rather than dressed as literature.
- **The overlay never touches `status`:** zero `status:` lines changed in the diff, and BE-37 and
  BE-48 remain `speculative`. Row and edge counts are unchanged at 55 and 41 — the overlay changes
  CONTENT, never count.
- `data/bridge-catalog.json` regenerated (`bun run catalog:json`), which is what row edits require:
  `tests/bridges/catalog-json.test.ts` deep-equals the committed artifact against the live
  registry and was EXPECTED RED between the row edits and this regeneration.

### Added

- **Atlas Sprint 1 — relation contracts as an additive overlay.** `relation?`, `conventions?` and
  `counterexamples?` are now OPTIONAL fields on `BridgeEdge` and `BridgeEquationEntry`
  (`conventions?` only on `CanonicalEquation`); `RelationContract` and `Conventions` live in
  `src/atlas/types.ts`; `composeRelation` is a literal 8×8 table in `src/atlas/composition-table.ts`;
  `composeEdges` consults it and throws `UndefinedCompositionError` on a refused pair; and
  `src/atlas/derive-evidence.ts` + `src/atlas/coverage.ts` derive evidence tags at read time.
  Everything is `@internal` behind the `universal-physics-tensor/atlas` subpath.
- **Evidence tags are DERIVED, never stored.** No row carries an evidence set and
  `derive-evidence.ts` has no write path. Verified against the real catalog rather than fixtures:
  all 55 `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS` rows derive 47 × `{proposed}` (bridge), 5 × `{contradicted}`
  (rejected) and 3 × `{proposed}` (unadjudicated). **No existing record gains evidence**, which is
  the migration's whole claim.
- The composition table is deliberately a **conservative under-approximation**: 8 defined cells of
  64, the other 56 `'no-composite-claim'`. A wrong composite type is a false physical claim; silence
  is only silence. Two cells the implementation plan asserted were rejected during design review —
  `exact-equivalence ∘ approximation` (an exact equivalence contributes `IDENTITY_BOUND` only in the
  norm a bridge states, and no field records a norm) and `structural-analogy ∘ structural-analogy`
  (analogy is not transitive). Reasoning in `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-1-Design.md` §0 and §2.2.

### Fixed

- **`master` is green again after nine CI-red commits.** The `docs-fresh` job reported
  `docs/architecture/dependency-graph.yaml` as 162 lines stale and no regeneration here could
  close it. The cause was outside the repo: local `node_modules` carried **js-yaml 5.2.3** while
  `bun.lock` resolves **5.4.2**, and CI installs `--frozen-lockfile`. The two versions quote a
  string containing `": "` differently — `'single'` vs `"double"` — and exactly 81 module
  descriptions contain `": "`, which is the 162 changed lines. No content ever differed.
  `bun install --frozen-lockfile` then `bun run docs:deps` reproduces CI's output (`082af58`).
  **The trap worth remembering: the wrong-version regeneration was perfectly IDEMPOTENT**, so it
  read as correct. A generator is stable at a wrong answer whenever its own version is the input
  nobody pinned.

### Changed

- **Atlas Phase 0 is recorded as implemented but NOT closed**, in `ROADMAP.md` §7, `ACTIVE.md`
  and `todo.md`. The code shipped (nine models, five typed bridges, one rejection, fifteen
  witnesses, 126 atlas tests inside 384 files / 3,959 tests, exit 0, nothing on `src/index.ts`).
  Two exit criteria remain open and neither is code: independent physicist review, and curation
  cost at per-bridge granularity. The `ACTIVE.md` box is deliberately left unticked rather than
  ticked on the code alone, and Sprint 1 is not promoted.
- **`docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-0-Curation-Cost.md` reports per-AGENT cost and says why**, instead
  of estimating the per-bridge rows `ROADMAP.md` §L0.2 asks for. Work was dispatched per agent and
  several agents owned two or three bridges, so per-bridge hours were never instrumented;
  splitting them by intuition would manufacture the one number the pilot exists to measure. The
  supported finding is that **relation type did not drive cost — specification quality did**: all
  three bridge agents took comparable wall-clock across exact, singular-approximation and
  coarse-graining work, while both costly defects were in the plan (a W6 arithmetic error, and
  `deriveRegimeGroups` double-adding dimensionless inputs).
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` opens its physics-review list with the atlas pilot**, naming the specific
  claims to attack, because that review is a roadmap exit criterion no in-repo work can satisfy.

### Added

- **Full suite verified and the Phase 0 curation-cost log filled.** `bun run test`: **384 files
  passed / 1 skipped, 3,959 tests passed / 4 skipped / 1 todo**, exit 0 — against a stated baseline
  of ≈3,700 across ~353 files, so the atlas work broke nothing. `bun run package:check` exit 0.
  `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-0-Curation-Cost.md` records what was actually measured, and says
  plainly what was not: **per-bridge cost was never instrumented**, so the finest honest granularity
  is per agent, and several agents owned two or three bridges. Splitting an agent's wall-clock
  across its bridges by intuition would manufacture the very number the pilot exists to measure.
  **The finding:** relation type did *not* drive cost in Sprint 0 — specification quality did. The
  two defects that cost real time were both in the plan (the W6 arithmetic error; `deriveRegimeGroups`
  double-adding its dimensionless inputs), not in any bridge, and neither is a function of relation
  type. For Sprint 4/5 scoping: budget adversarial review of the specification at least as heavily
  as implementation.

- **Citation theatre removed from two atlas bridges, and an empty citation list filled.** Found while
  pre-scanning Eve's item 9 ("confirm no field was populated by guess"). `ab-spring-lc` and
  `ab-damped-rlc` cited `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-0-Design.md §3, §6` — **our own planning
  document**, i.e. the document that asserted the claim. That is circular, and it is *worse* than an
  empty array because it looks sourced and would satisfy any check that only asks whether
  `citations[]` is non-empty. It is the citation equivalent of the evidence-tag theatre that
  `evidence-rule.test.ts` exists to catch. `ab-chain-wave` carried an empty array for a standard
  solid-state result.
  Both now cite real literature (the force-voltage analogy; the monatomic-chain dispersion and its
  continuum limit), citing **work and topic rather than precise section numbers** — a section number
  stated without the edition in hand is the same fabrication in a more confident costume.
  `reviewStatus` remains `'proposed'` on every bridge until the independent physicist review lands.
  Not a defect: `AtlasRejection` has no `citations` field by design.

- **Atlas Phase 0, Sprint 0 wave 3 — assembly, JSON projection, and the evidence-tag rule.**
  `src/atlas/oscillators/index.ts` (`OSCILLATOR_FAMILY`), `src/atlas/serialize.ts` (`toAtlasJson`),
  `scripts/emit-atlas-json.mjs`, and the committed artifact `data/atlas/oscillators.json`
  (9 models, 5 bridges, 1 rejection, schema v0, packageVersion 0.45.2). Plus four test files:
  serialize, schema-pin, atlas-json deep-equal, and the evidence rule.
  `vitest run tests/atlas`: **14 files, 126 tests**, up from 10/89 at wave 2.

  **The evidence rule is the anti-theatre gate and it is built to fail.** A tag is carried on a
  record only if the witness supporting it passes in that record's own test file; a tag with no
  witness is theatre, and so is a witness id no test ever names. Matching is whole-word
  (`new RegExp('\\b' + id + '\\b')`), so `W1` is **not** satisfied by a title saying `W1a` —
  a substring match would make the gate pass vacuously, which is worse than having no gate.
  Four negative tests prove it can actually fail: a substring hit is rejected, a fabricated
  witness id is rejected, a real id pointed at the wrong file is rejected, and the scanner itself
  is checked to be reading this tree rather than a phantom path.

  Three serialization traps avoided, each verified in the emitted artifact rather than in the
  source: `evidence` is a **sorted array** (a `ReadonlySet` JSON-stringifies to `{}`, which would
  have shipped an artifact that looked populated and was empty); `horizonHolds` is serialized as
  its `horizon` **prose only**, with no function leaking into JSON; and two consecutive emits are
  byte-identical (`md5 c89bb0c7…`), so the deep-equal pin in `atlas-json.test.ts` fails on a stale
  artifact the way `catalog-json.test.ts` does.

- **Atlas Phase 0, Sprint 0 wave 2 — the five bridges, the rejection, and the quantum witnesses.**
  `src/atlas/oscillators/bridges-exact.ts` (`ab-spring-lc` exact equivalence; `ab-damped-rlc` with
  the side condition `b/√(mk) = R√(C/L)`), `bridges-limits.ts` (`ab-pendulum-linear`, a *regular*
  approximation with bound `(K=1, δ=θ0²/16)`; `ab-damped-massless`, a *singular* one with
  `δ = 2(1+|v0|)m/b`), `bridges-coarse.ts` (`ab-chain-wave` coarse-graining), `rejections.ts`
  (`ax-cubic-spring-lc`, claimed exact-equivalence, surviving group `β x0²/k`), and
  `src/atlas/witnesses/quantum-support.ts`. All fifteen witnesses `W1…W9` are executable tests.
  `vitest run tests/atlas`: **10 files, 89 tests**, up from 6/43 at wave 1.

  Three details worth recording because they are the difference between a test that checks physics
  and one that checks itself:
  - **W7 computes the elliptic integral by AGM, never a truncated series.** An independent reviewer
    computed `K` from a four-term hypergeometric series, obtained `1.575079505` against AGM's
    `1.574732341`, and drew a wrong conclusion about the residual — which is itself a
    fourth-significant-figure quantity. The witness and its brief both say AGM for that reason.
  - **W2 derives `R` from the side condition** (`R = 2·ζ_mech / √(C/L)`) and *then* asserts it
    equals 2, rather than feeding `R = 2` in as an input. A test that is handed the answer is not
    testing the condition.
  - **W3 asserts `verdict === 'dimensionally-independent'`**, not a π-group count. It also covers
    both `{L, C, q0}` and the set the atlas actually declares for `model-lc`, `{L, C}`, since those
    differ — and confirms the verdict is the same either way.

- **Atlas Phase 0 (oscillator pilot), Sprint 0 wave 1 — the typed-relation foundation.** New
  `src/atlas/` module, `@internal` throughout and reachable only through the
  `universal-physics-tensor/atlas` subpath: `types.ts` (the pilot type set — `RelationType`,
  `EvidenceTag`, `Regime`/`RegimeInequality`, `ApproximationBound` with a mandatory machine
  `horizonHolds`, `AtlasBridge`, `AtlasRejection`), `error-algebra.ts` (`composeBounds`,
  `IDENTITY_BOUND`, `composeBoundPath`), `regime.ts` (`deriveRegimeGroups`, `regimeHolds`), and
  `oscillators/{dimensions,models}.ts` (the nine oscillator models). Plus `tests/atlas/_ode.ts`
  (a local fixed-step RK4 with sampling), `data/schemas/atlas-record.v0.json` (draft-07, as
  DOCUMENTATION — there is no validator in this tree), import-graph and exports-subpath guards,
  and the `./atlas` subpath with `test:atlas` / `atlas:json` scripts.
  6 test files, 43 tests. No existing type changed; `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS` and `CATALOG_GRAPH`
  untouched; nothing re-exported from `src/index.ts`.

- **Two defects in the Atlas plan were found and corrected before any code was written**, both
  recorded in `docs/planning/Atlas-Phase-0-Design.md`:
  - The plan's own arithmetic for witness W6 was wrong — it stated
    `(5,7) ∘ ((3,2) ∘ (2,1)) = (30, 17)`; the correct value is `(30, 32)`. Found on the
    adversarial vet and verified by *executing* the composition rule. The test asserts `(30, 32)`
    and explicitly `.not.toEqual({K: 30, delta: 47})`.
  - `deriveRegimeGroups` would have double-added its dimensionless inputs. Measured by running
    `buckinghamPi` rather than reading it: it already returns a trivial group for an all-zero
    dimension variable, keyed by the variable's own name in `formula`. The implementation passes
    the inputs in and keys by `formula`, synthesizing nothing.

- **`SPRING_CONSTANT` is defined twice**, identically, in `src/canonical/entries/mechanics.ts:35`
  and `fluids-waves.ts:48` — two sources of truth for one dimension. `tests/atlas/models.test.ts`
  now asserts the atlas definition against **both**, so a future divergence fails a test instead of
  being silently picked, and it carries a companion test proving that reader can actually fail.

- **`ROADMAP.md` — strategic direction from bridge catalog to verified physics atlas.** Informed by
  the three 2026-09-20 proposal documents (*Physics as a Graph* draft → *Physics Equation Atlas*
  revised proposal → *Blueprint v2*). Inventories what UPT already has against the proposal's
  record model (dimension layer, validity domains, epistemic status, confrontations, firewall),
  names the gaps (relation-type contracts, regime records on dimensionless groups, `(K, δ)`
  error-carrying composition, evidence-tag vector, hyperedge derivations, conventions,
  associations, formal references, an invalid-bridge benchmark), and lays out seven phases with
  exit criteria, numbered to match Blueprint v2 §9. Records where repo invariants override the
  proposal (no Python, zero hard deps, flat CLI verbs, additive overlay only, Product A frozen,
  no in-package UI). Not a release-blocking backlog: phases are promoted through `ACTIVE.md`
  with a design note and Adam+Eve review. Linked from the README's planning section.

- **`docs/planning/Atlas-Roadmap-Implementation-Plan.md` — subagent-driven execution plan for
  `ROADMAP.md`.** Follows the `todo.md` §Conventions swarm mapping (Lead owns design notes,
  dispatch, and every commit; file-scoped implementer briefs with pre-execution verification
  gates, scoped-vitest TDD, no-commit, and mandatory deviation reports; Adam design vet and Eve
  value-level verification always independent). Sprint 0 (oscillator pilot) is specified to
  brief level: six implementer briefs over three waves under a new `src/atlas/` subpath, the
  fifteen Blueprint v2 witnesses with numeric expectations and tolerances (pendulum period
  error 0.002506 at 0.2 rad, RLC side condition, chain dispersion coefficient 1/24, chirped
  Gaussian `(ħ/2)√(1+16α²s⁴)`, singular `m→0` boundary layer), the `(K, δ)` error algebra with
  its associativity witness, regime groups derived via `buckinghamPi`, an evidence-tag rule
  test so no tag exists without a witness, and a schema-validated JSON export. Sprints 1–6
  carry the same structure (Scout / Adam / briefs / Eve / wrap), a cross-sprint invariant
  table, and the rule that Sprint 4–5 scope is set by the measured Sprint 0 curation cost.
  Overlay fields land on `BridgeEquationEntry` as well as `BridgeEdge`, because 17
  catalog rows have no graph edge. No code change; nothing is authorized until a
  sprint is promoted into `ACTIVE.md`.
  **Revision 2 (same day):** an independent adversarial review and a codebase-consistency
  audit of revision 1 found, and this revision fixes, a wrong RLC resistance in the pilot
  witnesses (`R = 2` matches, `R = 4` is the counterexample), three unachievable witness
  tolerances (singular-limit position instead of velocity, a pointwise Wick-rotation residual,
  a self-contradictory pendulum window), a same-wave file race, a hidden same-wave dependency
  in Sprint 1, an assumed JSON-Schema validator the tree does not have, a held-out benchmark
  family the atlas would already encode, and several wrong catalog facts (BE-51/52 do have
  graph edges — 17 rows are edgeless, 13 are AST-less; BE-37/48 are `speculative`; BE-35 is
  both confronted and rejected; no test pins the canonical count of 103). ROADMAP corrected
  in step: fifteen Appendix A corrections, not fourteen; phase numbering mapped to Blueprint
  §9 rather than claimed equal; fourteen enumerable witnesses with the fifteenth unidentified;
  all fifteen poster bridge lines typed per Appendix A; the composition matrix declared a
  conservative under-approximation of §4.2; practical-value and curation-cost restored to the
  pre-stated criteria; the dropped 50–100-family corpus target recorded as a non-commitment.

### Fixed

- **PR #174's `lowerFirstIndex` N=4 unroll shifted line counts and staled the committed
  dependency-graph docs**, failing the `docs-fresh` CI check. Ran `bun run docs:deps` on the
  PR branch and committed the regenerated files, rather than editing generated output.

### Added

- **`tests/numerical/lower-first-index-n4-unroll.test.ts` pins the N=4 unrolled branch of
  `lowerFirstIndex` against an inline copy of the generic loop** (relative 1e-15) on
  Schwarzschild, Painleve-Gullstrand (off-diagonal) and eight seeded random dense
  symmetric metrics. No prior test compared the two paths. A deliberate index swap in the
  unrolled branch fails all three cases.

- **PR #173's Riemann-contraction inner-loop unroll (N=4) shifted line counts and staled the
  committed dependency-graph docs**, failing the `docs-fresh` CI check
  (`DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`, `dependency-graph.json/yaml`, `dependency-summary.compact.json`).
  Ran `bun run docs:deps` on the PR branch and pushed the regenerated files rather than
  bypassing the gate, so CI went green for the right reason before merge.

- **The architecture-docs gate failed on `master`: seven stale metric claims across six
  files.** The repo grew after the September Bolt and Dependabot merges, and the
  hand-written metric tables were not updated with it: 703 source files claimed vs 710
  actual, 2373 exports vs 2377, 109613 lines vs 110765, 672 type-only imports vs 676, and
  27 unused exports vs 26. The `src/`-scope prose in `OVERVIEW.md`, which no gate can
  verify, was re-measured at the same time (1971 exports, 988 re-exports). The numbers are
  corrected in place rather than regenerated, because these files are hand-written prose
  with embedded metric tables, not generator output — `docs:deps` rebuilds only the
  dependency-graph artifacts and does not touch them. This is the same drift class that
  `bdd830f` repaired on 2026-08-21, which confirms nothing yet fails when it recurs: the
  repo's `docs-fresh` CI job still checks only the `docs:deps` set, so the repo_map set
  drifts unwatched between manual runs.

- **`docs:deps` and `audit:plans` broke under TypeScript 7, and the fix deleted a
  script rather than pinning around it.** Both ran through
  `scripts/run-ts-tool.mjs`, which called `ts.transpileModule` to compile a
  TypeScript tool before running it under Node. TS 7.0 removed that programmatic API,
  so `ts.ScriptTarget` was `undefined` and both scripts died with
  `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ES2022')`.

  This repo already runs Bun, and Bun executes TypeScript directly -- so the
  transpile-then-run dance was never needed. Both scripts now call
  `bun tools/<tool>.ts`, and `scripts/run-ts-tool.mjs` is deleted along with its
  dependency on an API that no longer exists. The two READMEs documenting the old
  invocation are updated with it.

### Changed

- **TypeScript raised to `^7.0.2` and Bun pinned to 1.4.2.** Part of the fleet move to
  the current releases of both. `packageManager`, `engines.bun` and the CI workflow
  move together -- a version the manifest declares but CI does not install is a pin
  that enforces nothing.

### Changed

- **Local/CI toolchain moves to Bun; Node remains the shipped runtime.** `bun.lock` is committed
  and `package-lock.json` is removed (one lockfile per manifest). CI keeps `setup-node` alongside
  `setup-bun`: Bun installs and drives scripts (`bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run …`);
  Node is what the published library runs on. Dependabot uses `package-ecosystem: bun` so PRs
  update the lockfile. Script bodies still invoke `node`/`tsc`/`vitest` — `bun run` only drives
  them. Verified before commit: after `rm -rf node_modules && bun install --frozen-lockfile`,
  the MathTS `github:` deps (`typed-function`, `workerpool`) are present — the failure mode that
  forced the Aug 2026 revert under Bun 1.4.0. Pin is Bun 1.4.2.

## [0.45.2] - 2026-09-04

### Performance

- **`nestedZeros4` / `nestedZeros5` use an unrolled literal for the N=4 relativity case** (#160).
  The 4x4x4x4 and 4x4x4x4x4 zero tensors are now returned as array literals instead of built by
  four/five levels of `new Array` plus loops, taking V8's fast literal-allocation path. The
  dynamic construction remains for every other N.
  Verified before merge: the literal parses to shape [4,4,4,4] with 256 zero elements and no
  ragged level, and every innermost array is a distinct literal -- `nestedZeros5` calls
  `nestedZeros4(4)` four separate times rather than reusing one result, preserving the
  "independent inner arrays" contract these helpers document. Both functions are module-local,
  so no public API changed and this ships as a patch.

### Fixed

- **Regenerated `docs/architecture/` after the 0.45.1 bump.** The generated dependency artifacts
  embed the package version, so the release commit left them one version behind and the
  `docs-fresh` gate turned `master` red. The gate was right; the release was incomplete.
  Regenerated with `npm run docs:deps` rather than hand-edited -- editing a generated file only
  moves the failure to the next regeneration.

## [0.45.1] - 2026-09-04

### Performance

- **GL4 integrator: double-buffered state arrays remove a per-step allocation from the hot loop**
  (#159). `src/numerical/gl4-integrator.ts` previously sliced fresh state arrays inside the
  step loop; the two buffers are now allocated once and swapped. Internal only -- no exported
  symbol changed, which is why this ships as a patch rather than a minor.

### Changed

- **`CLAUDE.md` no longer restates the release history, and its publish command is corrected.**
  The "Current release state" section claimed v0.43.0 was the latest npm release while v0.45.0 was
  published. It was 109 lines duplicating what `CHANGELOG.md`, `todo.md` and
  `docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md` already carry — a fourth copy, and the one nobody updated.
  Deleted rather than synced; syncing re-arms the drift. Replaced with a pointer to the real
  sources.
  More consequentially, the documented publish command was `npm publish --ignore-scripts`,
  justified as *"always on Windows — skips `prepublishOnly` (vitest cold-start tax)"*. That reason
  was wrong: the real cause was `package-smoke` dying with `spawnSync npm.cmd EINVAL`, fixed in
  0.45.0. The flag therefore no longer skips a slow gate — it disables a **working** one. Both the
  command table and the release procedure now publish without it, and require verifying against
  the registry with `--prefer-online`, since plain `npm view` serves a stale cache immediately
  after a publish.


## [0.45.0] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **`package:check` could never run on Windows, so `prepublishOnly` blocked every release.**
  `scripts/package-smoke.mjs` called `execFileSync('npm.cmd', ...)`, and Node >= 18.20.2 /
  >= 20.12.2 refuse to spawn a `.cmd` without a shell (the CVE-2024-27980 argument-injection
  fix), so it died with `spawnSync npm.cmd EINVAL`. **CI runs on ubuntu and never reached this
  path, while publishing happens only from the Windows box** -- so every gate stayed green and
  the release still could not go out. Found by an actual `npm publish` failing, not by a check.
  `shell: true` on win32 only; every argument is a literal, none derived from input.

### Added

- **Issue forms for the physics-review surface** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`). Five forms plus a
  `config.yml`, each mapped to a bounded task that already exists in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: bridge
  adjudication, literature check, quantity identification/naming, novel-candidate verdict, and
  NOT-A-BRIDGE rebuttal. `config.yml` links the JSON review surface so a contributor never has to
  read TypeScript to participate.
  **Every form requires a human-verifiable literature anchor**, and says why in the field itself —
  the status-promotion rule holds that no status moves toward `established` on internal review,
  human or LLM, alone. Validated against GitHub's issue-forms schema rather than merely parsed as
  YAML, since a valid file with the wrong keys renders as nothing at all.

### Fixed

- **`weyl-lowering` loop and array-literal optimizations** (#158). Unrolls the remaining fixed-
  dimension loops in the Weyl assembly path and returns native array literals rather than
  index-assigning into pre-allocated arrays. Merged after the accuracy suite (`long-tests`) ran
  on the pull request and passed -- the gate that exists precisely because this file's previous
  optimization round shipped a defect.
  This PR also carried an independent fix for the `RS_delta_rho_mu` / `RS_g_sigma_mu` compile
  break, by inlining `RS * delta_rho_mu` at the two use sites. That form was kept over the
  hoisted one restored in c2a2edb: each product is used exactly once, so the intermediate
  binding bought nothing.

- **`master` did not compile.** `src/numerical/weyl-lowering.ts` referenced `RS_delta_rho_mu` and
  `RS_g_sigma_mu` at both `prefactor5` and `prefactor6`, but the two `const` declarations that
  produced them had been removed. `TS2552` twice, which failed **`test`** and **`quality`**
  together, since both typecheck. Introduced by #149 (`perf(numerical): optimize Weyl tensor
  assembly loop operations`), which deleted the two hoists while keeping their uses.
  Restored both declarations rather than inlining `RS * delta_rho_mu` per element: they are
  loop-invariant in `nu`, which is why they were hoisted in the first place, so inlining would
  have quietly undone part of the optimization that PR exists to add.
  Verified against ground truth rather than just the compiler -- the Schwarzschild, Kerr-Schild
  and reference Weyl suites (12 tests) assert against closed-form analytic solutions and pass.

- **`docs/architecture/` was stale, so the `docs-fresh` gate was correctly red.** Regenerated;
  `totalLinesOfCode` had drifted 55394 -> 55410 across four generated artifacts. Source had
  landed without `npm run docs:deps`.

- **Removed a duplicate `## [Unreleased]` heading.** Two existed; entries filed under the lower
  one sat below released versions and read as history rather than as pending work -- invisible
  in exactly the place a reader looks for what is coming. Its bullets were folded into the
  single remaining `### Changed`.

- **Two stale `todo.md` entries corrected with measurements rather than closed on assertion.** Both
  described work that no longer exists, and a tracker listing phantom work is a dead gauge:
  - *"DGT 5th false-positive class"* — the defect is **real but confirmed cosmetic**. Ground truth is
    **8** files carrying a full `import ... from` inside a block comment (not the 5 recorded, and
    `lowering.ts` has a line comment rather than a block one), and cross-checking the emitted
    `dependency-graph.json` shows **0** of them reach a real edge. The proposed root fix — strip
    comment blocks before all regex scans — is more dangerous than the defect: naive comment
    stripping in TypeScript breaks on `//` in string literals, regex literals, template literals and
    unterminated blocks, so doing it correctly means rewriting the scanner on the TypeScript compiler
    API to fix output nothing consumes. Closed, with the reopen condition stated.
  - *"`unused-analysis.md` 19-export cull"* — the regenerated report now reads **0 unused files, 0
    unused exports**. The 19 are already gone.

- **README no longer hardcodes a version number.** `## Development Status` read `v0.44.1` while the
  package was at `0.44.3`. Fixed by removing the duplicate rather than syncing it — `package.json`
  and this CHANGELOG are the sources of truth, and nothing gates the README, so a number copied
  there drifts silently every release. The paragraph already claimed to avoid "release-by-release
  counts that can drift" while carrying the one that always does.

- **The numerical accuracy gate ran but did not gate.** `long-tests` carried a job-level `if:` that
  skipped it on PRs touching no numerical code. That made it impossible to require: a required
  status context that never appears blocks a pull request forever. So the job ran, could fail, and
  nothing stopped the merge — a gauge wearing a gate's name. It was added specifically so a
  floating-point change could not merge unchecked, after the v0.44.3 reassociation passed every PR
  check and was caught only by running the suite by hand.
  The job now runs **unconditionally** and gates the expensive suite at **step** level: on a PR with
  no numerical changes it runs, does nothing, and reports success in seconds — cheap, and always
  present for branch protection to match. `quality`, `docs-fresh` and `long-tests` are now required
  status contexts alongside `test`.

### Security

- **`ci.yml` now pins `permissions: contents: read` explicitly** instead of inheriting the
  repository default. The default is `read` today, but it is a repo-level setting any future change
  can widen silently, and a workflow with no block inherits whatever it becomes. Every job here only
  checks out, builds, type-checks, tests, audits, or diffs generated docs — none needs more. Found
  by a fleet-wide sweep for this pattern after the same gap turned up in two sibling repos.

### Changed

- **Gitignored `.tracker-watch.json`.** The tracker-discipline Stop hook seeds that file at
  whichever root it is invoked from, declaring the paths an agent's work lands in. It is agent
  infrastructure rather than project content, so it stays out of the published tree without
  showing up as untracked noise on every `git status`.

- **The accuracy suite now runs on pull requests that touch `src/numerical/`.** `long-tests` was
  schedule/dispatch only, so a PR could change floating-point code and merge with the one suite
  that would catch a regression never having run. v0.44.3 was exactly that shape — a term-by-term
  FP reassociation in `weyl-lowering`, green on every PR check, and covered only because the
  accuracy tests were run by hand. This repo has been bitten before: the GL4 step-halving bug was
  invisible precisely because its accuracy test was skip-by-default.
  A `numerical-touched` job computes the answer with `git diff` rather than a third-party
  paths-filter action — one less action to SHA-pin and audit for a two-line check. The nightly
  schedule and manual dispatch paths are unchanged.

## [0.44.3] - 2026-08-28

**Dep health:** `npm audit` reports **0 vulnerabilities**. The optional
`@danielsimonjr/mathts-*` peers still lag their latest releases and are again deliberately not
bumped in a patch, for the reason given in 0.44.2 — MathTS is mid-release and would move them
straight away.

### Performance

Three allocation/loop optimisations in the numerical core, all behaviour-preserving. No public
API change, which is why this is a patch.

- **`weyl-lowering`: Weyl tensor loops and arrays unrolled** (#140). `toNested4x4` returns explicit
  4x4 literals instead of building rows in a loop; `raiseRicciFirstIndex` is fully unrolled; and
  the inner Weyl expression hoists six invariant prefactors out of the `mu` loop.
  The algebraic refactor was verified equivalent term by term before merge — each prefactor
  reproduces its original grouping, including the two sign flips inside the `-0.5(…)` bracket.
- **`float64-engine`: tensor allocation hoisted out of einsum loops** (#139).
- **`gl4-integrator`: array allocation reduced in the step loop** (#138).

### Verification

A term-by-term floating-point reassociation is exactly the change an accuracy suite exists to
catch, and `long-tests` is schedule/dispatch only — it does **not** run on pull requests. So the
accuracy tests were run by hand for this release rather than assumed from a green PR:

- Full suite with `GL4_LONG=1 UPT_REQUIRE_PEERS=1`: **3795 passed, 1 todo, 0 failures** (363 files).
- GL4 integrator matches the Schwarzschild radial-infall cycloid to **≤1e-13** relative at 5000 steps.
- BE-37 Shapiro step sweep: relErr **2.28e-8** at 2048 steps, **5.02e-8** at 4096.
- `tsc --noEmit` and the strict whole-repo `tsconfig.tests.json` gate both clean.
- `docs-fresh` and the `repo_map` drift gate both pass.

## [0.44.2] - 2026-08-25

**Dep health:** `npm audit` reports **0 vulnerabilities**. The optional
`@danielsimonjr/mathts-*` peers lag their latest releases; they are deliberately not
bumped in a patch, since MathTS is mid-release and would move them again immediately.

### Performance

- **`weyl-lowering`: inner `nu` loop unrolled** (#136).
- **GL4 integrator: state updates hoisted and unrolled** (#134), following the earlier
  Picard-stage derivative hoist.

Both are hot-path arithmetic changes with no API surface change, hence a patch.

### Fixed

- **Reverted to npm for installs.** Bun drops this project's git dependencies, so the Bun
  migration is reverted here specifically; CI still installs Bun in the jobs that use it,
  and the npm cache directive the migration invalidated is gone.
- **Architecture docs regenerated** where the freshness gate flagged them, and stale metric
  claims corrected across 7 files plus `totalLinesOfCode` at HEAD.

### Fixed

- **`docs/architecture/` metric claims corrected across 7 files.** The `repo_map`
  gate was failing on stale numbers: 658 source files claimed vs 703 actual, 2103
  exports vs 2373, 104327 LOC vs 109532, 3 entry roots vs 4, 258 reachable vs 282.
  The repo's own `docs-fresh` CI job covers only the `docs:deps` artifacts
  (`DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`, `dependency-graph.*`, `TEST_COVERAGE.md`) — the
  repo_map-generated set (`OVERVIEW`, `COMPONENTS`, `DATAFLOW`, `FILE_INVENTORY`,
  `API`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `duplicate-symbols`) was checked by nothing and had drifted.
  Prose figures the gate cannot verify were re-measured too: the `src/`-scope
  sentence now reads 290 files / 1967 exports / 986 re-exports.

- **Added `.gitattributes`; `npm test` and `npm run docs:deps` no longer dirty the
  working tree on Windows.** Every tracked text file was already LF in the index
  (1157 `i/lf`, 0 `i/crlf`) but nothing declared it, so normalization depended on
  each developer's global `core.autocrlf`. Files checked out CRLF while the
  generators and the snapshot writer emit LF, producing diffs with no content
  difference whatsoever. A dirty tree that means nothing is worse than noise — it
  hides a dirty tree that means something.

- **`solveGL4Stage`: restored two sparsity guards dropped during the 4D loop
  unrolling.** The unrolled `nu` blocks assigned the `rho = 0` term unguarded
  (`pDotTerm = dg * p`) and accumulated `dp += pDotTerm * p` unguarded, where the
  loop they replaced guarded both. For finite inputs this is invisible — a
  50000-step Schwarzschild integration is bit-for-bit identical either way — but
  `0 * NaN` is `NaN`, so an unguarded term manufactures a non-finite value out of a
  coefficient that contributes nothing. `geodesicRHS` and `solveGL4Stage` now guard
  consistently.

### Added

- **`tests/numerical/non-finite-propagation.test.ts`** — pins how NaN and Infinity
  travel through the integrators. Previously `geodesicRHS` was unguarded (one NaN
  poisoned all four output components) while `solveGL4Stage` was guarded (the
  blow-up stayed local), so the same input produced two different kinds of answer
  depending on which integrator ran. Both are now component-local, and a non-finite
  input must remain VISIBLE in the output rather than being silently erased.

- **Experimental Product B expression/residual search** (`src/composition/probe/`, CLI
  `upt probe`). Orthogonal to the frozen Product A identification funnel
  (`upt discover` / `VettedCandidate`). Native Buckingham monomial enumerator, MHC
  holdout isolation, search budgets, corpus-relative novelty wording, declared-limit
  falsification, optional NDJSON workers (no vendored Python), and Family B fixtures
  under `tests/fixtures/discovery/`. Experimental subpath `universal-physics-tensor/probe`.
  Relation-link / regime-transition gaps abstain (`non-identifiable`) and redirect to
  `upt discover`. Integration note:
  `docs/planning/Scientific-Bridge-Discovery-v1-Integration.md`.

### Fixed

- **Regenerated the architecture graph, which had drifted about six weeks.** The committed
  artifacts still described `0.43.0` (2026-07-06). Three subsystems added since were absent
  from every generated view: `bridges/evaluators`, `composition/axis-audit` and
  `composition/axes`. Per-area counts moved with them — `cli` 24 → 27 files, `bridges`
  88 → 89 — and several bridge rows undercounted their test files.
  Regenerate with `npm run docs:deps`.

- **The architecture docs can no longer rot silently.** Nothing checked that the committed
  artifacts matched the code, which is why the drift above survived six weeks. A `docs-fresh`
  CI job now regenerates them and fails when the result differs from what is committed.
  - This required making the generator **reproducible** first. It stamped the current date into
    four places (`lastUpdated` in the graph JSON, the `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` header, and two
    footers) plus a `generatedAt` ISO timestamp in `test-coverage.json`. Every regeneration
    therefore differed from the last, which would have turned the gate red daily for reasons
    unrelated to the code. Nothing read any of them. Removed — the output is now a pure
    function of the repository, verified by generating three times and diffing.
  - The `**Version**` line stays: it comes from `package.json`, so it moves only on a real
    release, and the gate then correctly demands a regeneration as part of that release.
  - **The gate paid for itself immediately.** Its first run went red: `readdirSync` returns
    filesystem order, which is roughly alphabetical on NTFS but hash order on ext4, so a
    Windows-generated artifact and a Linux-generated one differed by a 506-line reordering with
    no content change at all. Determinism had been verified on one platform only. Both
    traversal sites now sort.
  - Two further date stamps survived the first sweep (`**Generated**` in `unused-analysis.md`
    and a `d:` field in the compact summary) because the search was for one spelling rather than
    for `new Date` generally. Both removed; the generator is now grepped clean of every
    time-, random- and environment-dependent source.
  - The three generated reports now carry a **generator-emitted** do-not-edit banner and an
    explicit `repo-map:no-verification` opt-out. Opting out is correct for them: `docs-fresh`
    byte-compares each against a fresh generation, which is stronger than a claim table. The
    marker is emitted by the generator, never added by hand — a hand-added marker survives
    only until the next regeneration.

### Added

- **The canonical architecture set is complete and gated.** Every document under
  `docs/architecture/` now either carries a `## Verification` block whose numbers the drift gate
  checks, or states an explicit, reasoned opt-out. `repo_map.py check` went from **17 failing
  documents to 0**.
  - New: `FILE_INVENTORY.md` and `duplicate-symbols.md`, the two canonical documents that were
    missing. The root README gained an Architecture index linking the whole set.
  - Nine documents opt out on stated grounds — three frozen version records, two audits, a
    benchmark log, two tutorials and the physics map, whose claims are about catalog entries,
    literature or wall-clock timings and are structurally outside a dependency graph.
  - **Two tool defects had to be fixed first, because the numbers were wrong.** The `bin/upt.mjs`
    launcher could not be resolved, so the whole `src/cli/` subtree read as dead; and `bench/`
    was not recognised as a benchmark zone. Orphan count **50 → 5**, and each of the 5 survivors
    is live code with a stated reason. Documenting before fixing would have published 45
    fabricated dead-code findings.

### Fixed (documentation drift)

- **Prose figures across the architecture set were roughly four minor versions stale.** Corrected
  against measurement, not against each other: source files 239 → 266 (`src` scope), exports
  1578 → 1764 (713 → 849 re-exports), bridge catalog 44 entries / IDs 11–54 → **55 entries /
  IDs 11–65**, real-data confrontations 9 → **19**, test suite 3600 → **3700 passing across 353
  files**, coverage 232/236 → **259/263**. `composition/` was described as both 31 and 45 files
  in the same document; it is 47.
  - Catalog figures were measured by importing the built package and reading `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS`,
    `CANONICAL_EQUATIONS`, `CATALOG_GRAPH` and `listConfrontations()` — not copied from prose.
  - One claim was **removed rather than updated**: "44 bridge evaluator modules (every catalogued
    bridge has an `evaluate*` function)". The invariant may well hold, but it was not measured,
    and restating it at 55 would have been a guess wearing a number.

## [0.44.1] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **GL4 stage solver: loop fusion, unrolling and common-subexpression elimination**
  (`src/numerical/gl4-integrator.ts`, +58/−48). The two-stage Gauss–Legendre fixed-point
  iteration previously walked the state vector once per stage per sweep; the stage loops
  are now fused and unrolled so each component is touched once, with the shared
  derivative terms hoisted out of the inner loop.

  Behaviour is unchanged — this is a performance refactor of the integrator's inner loop,
  not a change to its numerics. Verified against the full suite: **3,700 tests pass**
  across 352 files, including the GL4 benchmarks (`bench/gl4-mercury-1000step.bench.ts`,
  `bench/gl4-picard-alloc.bench.ts`). A refactor of a numerical integrator is precisely
  where a silent accuracy regression would hide, so the release is gated on the suite
  rather than on the diff reading correctly.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **CLI capability cluster — five commands/flags closing reproducibility & usability
  gaps (a PI capability-gap audit against the "every result is CLI-reproducible"
  claim).**
  - **`upt axes`** — the axis-discrimination audit, now CLI-reproducible. Prints the
    per-axis gated/checked/fires table behind the rank-7 finding (scale+force gate;
    topology/statistics/symmetry classify but don't gate). Closes the gap where the
    flagship measurement lived only in a research note.
  - **`upt evaluate <be-NN> key=value …`** — numerically evaluate any of the 13
    closed-form / spacetime bridges (BE-51/52/55…65) via a new `BRIDGE_EVALUATORS`
    registry + `evaluateBridge`. Previously *unreachable* from the CLI — `upt explain
    <be-NN>` even redirected to a capability that didn't exist. `upt evaluate be-63
    mu_e=2` → M_Ch ≈ 1.44 M_⊙.
  - **`upt confront --rigor=stringent|moderate|loose`** — filter the spine to one
    rigor tier (the precision core, or the loose tail that needs better data).
  - **`upt confront --frontier`** — rank the σ-tests by *margin to exclusion*
    (smallest = most at-risk under new data). Surfaces the PI insight that the
    precision core IS the falsification frontier: be-37 Shapiro sits 0.09σ from
    exclusion, be-58 JNT 0.19σ, be-51 lensing 0.33σ.
  - **`upt ground <a> <b>`** — the epistemic-grounding ledger for a single discovery
    candidate (passed falsifiers, gaps, and the honest permanent ceiling), queryable
    directly instead of scanning `upt discover`.
  - Also: `upt confront` and the four new commands are now listed in `upt help` (the
    `confront` command had been missing from help entirely).

- **`upt confront` now surfaces the evidence spine's RIGOR HIERARCHY.** A PI
  investigation characterized the 19-bridge spine by test precision and found it is
  *not* 19 equal confirmations: **7 stringent** (≤~0.5%) · **3 moderate** (~1–5%) ·
  **9 loose** (≥~10% / one-sided / order-of-magnitude). The precision core is now the
  quantum-metrology triangle (BE-55 QHE 8.6×10⁻¹¹, BE-59 Josephson 10⁻⁹, BE-58 JNT
  5 ppm) — tighter than the classic GR tests — while the whole astrophysics cluster
  sits in the loose tail. `upt confront` tags each line `[stringent|moderate|loose]`
  and prints a distribution header ("NOT N equal confirmations"); `--json` carries a
  per-confrontation `rigor` field + a `rigorDistribution`. New library:
  `CONFRONTATION_RIGOR` / `confrontationRigor` / `rigorDistribution` (author-declared,
  anti-inflation-cross-checked so no tier can be over-declared vs its computed
  precision — `confrontation-rigor.test.ts`). Reader-facing account updated in
  `docs/research/pi-instrument-results.md`.

### Changed

- **Symmetry axis tested and measured null — the rank-7 ceiling now holds across all
  three ungated axes.** Unlike topology/statistics (whose physics is closed-form and
  isolated), a sweep found the Symmetry axis *could* clash: at dimensionless `[1]`,
  conformal critical exponents sit alongside gauge couplings. So it was tested honestly —
  six graph quantities tagged with sourced symmetry (gauge couplings → `gauge`, spacetime
  curvatures → `poincare`, critical exponents → `conformal`) and the audit re-run. Result:
  **symmetry `checked=0, fires=0`** — *zero* funnel candidates involve any symmetry-tagged
  quantity, because the discovery funnel surfaces only UNCONNECTED cross-cluster
  coincidences and the symmetry-bearing quantities are all already-anchored/connected. The
  sweep over-counted; the funnel is decisive. Unified mechanism across all three axes now
  documented in `docs/research/rank7-axis-measurement.md`: the funnel's candidates never
  carry topology/statistics/symmetry (closed-form-isolated *or* already-connected). No gate
  flipped. Classification metadata added (honest); discovery behaviour unchanged.

### Fixed

- **CI red on every push + nightly schedule — the `tsc -p tsconfig.tests.json` gate failed
  on two unrelated pre-existing test bugs, neither a type/API drift.**
  - `tests/bridges/confrontation-rigor.test.ts`: `precisionOf()` took
    `o: ReturnType<typeof runConfrontation>` (`ConfrontationOutcome | undefined`) and
    discriminant-narrowed on `o.kind === 'value'` / `o.kind === 'consistency'` without first
    excluding `undefined`. TS cannot narrow a discriminated union through a possibly-undefined
    receiver, so `o` stayed the full 4-member union at every property access inside the
    branches, producing cascading `TS18048`/`TS2339` errors that *looked* like a stale-API
    mismatch (`sigma`/`observed`/`predicted`/`fractionalGap` reported "missing") but
    weren't — `ConfrontationOutcome`'s `'value'`/`'consistency'` variants have carried those
    exact fields, unchanged, since before this test was written (`git log` on both files:
    the type predates the test; the field names always matched). Fixed by guarding
    `if (o === undefined) return Infinity;` before the discriminant checks — the same
    "unconstrained precision" fallback the function already used for the `'table'`/
    `'upper-bound'` cases, so no assertion the test made changes meaning.
  - `tests/composition/grounding.test.ts`: a single-step `g as Record<string, unknown>` cast
    on `CandidateGrounding` (an object type with no index signature) is a `TS2352` — the two
    types don't sufficiently overlap for a direct assertion. Fixed with the codebase's
    existing double-cast idiom for this exact situation (`as unknown as Record<string,
    unknown>`, already used in `tests/diff/bridge-gradient.test.ts`), which is what the test
    actually needs: probe for an unexpected `tier` key without widening the type elsewhere.
  - No `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error`/`any`-casts/loosened `tsconfig`; no test skipped or
    removed. Verified: `npx tsc -p tsconfig.tests.json`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and
    `npm run build` all exit 0; `UPT_REQUIRE_PEERS=1 npx vitest run` passes in full.

## [0.43.0] — 2026-07-05

**Dependency health** (pre-flight): `npm audit` — **0 vulnerabilities**. `npm outdated`
— optional `@danielsimonjr/mathts-*` peers + devDeps have newer versions; not upgraded
(optional peers degrade gracefully). No HIGH/CRITICAL findings.

### Added

- **Astrophysics bridge cluster (BE-63…65) — catalog 52→55, evidence spine 16→19.**
  The second branch-physics expansion (spine-focused; carries only the already-gated
  gravity axis). Three established, data-confrontable, Adam/Eve-vetted closed-form
  bridges — all **consistency-with-caveat** (astrophysics scatters more than lab physics):
  - **BE-63 Chandrasekhar mass** (M_Ch≈1.44 M_⊙, degeneracy-pressure limit) — matches
    observed WD max ~1.35 M_⊙; **upper-bound caveat** (super-Chandrasekhar SNe reach
    2.4–2.8 M_⊙). Vet YELLOW/YELLOW.
  - **BE-64 Eddington luminosity** (L_Edd=4πGMm_p c/σ_T ≈1.26×10³¹ W/M_⊙) — the
    accretion ceiling; **spherical-symmetry caveat** (super-Eddington ULXs exist). Vet
    RED(Adam)/GREEN(Eve) on "tight" → resolved as consistency.
  - **BE-65 Jeans mass** (collapse criterion) — order-of-magnitude, confronted at the
    core-forming density (~1 M_⊙, honestly avoiding the "Jeans mass problem" at cloud-
    average density); **convention-dependent-prefactor caveat**. Vet GREEN/YELLOW.

  **The vet did its job:** BE-66 (TOV neutron-star max mass) was **DEFERRED unanimously**
  — the TOV limit is EOS-dependent (PSR J0740+6620=2.08 M_⊙, J0952-0607=2.35 M_⊙; range
  2.2–2.9), not a single-constant bridge, so it was dropped rather than fabricated. Design:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-05-astrophysics-cluster-design.md`.

## [0.42.0] — 2026-07-05

**Dependency health** (pre-flight): `npm audit` — **0 vulnerabilities**. `npm outdated`
— optional `@danielsimonjr/mathts-*` peers + devDeps have newer versions; not upgraded
(optional peers degrade gracefully). No HIGH/CRITICAL findings.

### Added

- **Condensed-matter bridge cluster (BE-59…62) + a MEASURED rank-7-axis ceiling —
  catalog 48→52, evidence spine 12→16.** The first branch-physics expansion,
  anchored at BE-55 (quantum Hall). Four established, data-confrontable, Adam/Eve-
  vetted closed-form bridges:
  - **BE-59 AC Josephson** (f=2eV/h) — **completes the quantum metrology triangle**
    with BE-55 (ohm, R_K) and BE-58 (kelvin, k_B via Johnson noise). Confronts the
    junction *universality* (non-circular; K_J is post-2019 definitional). statistics:
    bosonic (Cooper pair). Vet GREEN/GREEN.
  - **BE-60 Fractional QH** (Laughlin σ_xy=⅓·e²/h) — emergent topological order;
    confronts the ⅓ *fraction* (R_xy=3·R_K=77438.422 Ω). topology: chern (fractional),
    statistics: anyonic (e/3 quasiparticles). Vet GREEN/GREEN.
  - **BE-61 Wiedemann-Franz** (κ/σT=L₀=2.44×10⁻⁸) — degenerate-limit consistency;
    honest caveat recorded (Cu@0°C ~9% low; pure Ag@low-T recovers L₀). statistics tag
    STRIPPED (Eve YELLOW — contested). Vet GREEN/YELLOW.
  - **BE-62 BCS gap ratio** (2Δ=3.528 k_BT_c) — weak-coupling consistency; honest
    caveat (real range 3.5–5, strong-coupling Pb deviates). statistics tag STRIPPED
    (bosonic condensate of fermions — ambiguous). Vet GREEN/YELLOW.

  **The anti-inflation deliverable:** after tagging the honestly-fermionic graph
  quantities, `auditAxisDiscrimination` shows the topology/statistics axes at
  **`checked=0, fires=0`** — a fermion↔boson same-dimension sweep of all 131 graph
  quantities finds no clashable pair, so the axes *classify but do not gate*. This was
  **predicted from grounding, then measured** — no gate flipped. The physics carrying
  topology/statistics (quantized invariants) is too closed-form to graph-connect.
  Result note: `docs/research/rank7-axis-measurement.md`. Design:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-05-condensed-matter-cluster-design.md`.

### Changed

- **`upt explain <be-NN>` now redirects helpfully instead of emitting a bare "no
  derivation path".** A PI CLI investigation (post-v0.41.0) found that a bridge id is
  a graph *edge*, not a quantity *node* — so `explain` (which derives quantities) can
  never resolve one, and every `be-NN` target hit the same unhelpful message. The
  command now recognises a catalog bridge id and redirects, tailored by grounding
  tier: closed-form evaluator bridges (be-51/52/55–58, no graph edge) are named as
  such, graph-computable bridges point to `upt map`, and data-confronted bridges point
  to `upt confront <be-NN>` (bridges without a confrontation honestly say so — e.g.
  be-57 Unruh). `--json` carries a structured `{kind:'bridge-redirect', id, tier,
  hasGraphEdge, hasDataConfrontation, hint}` envelope. Quantity targets are unchanged.

## [0.41.0] — 2026-07-05

**Dependency health** (pre-flight): `npm audit` — **0 vulnerabilities**. `npm outdated`
— the optional `@danielsimonjr/mathts-*` peers and devDeps (`@types/node`, `js-yaml`)
have newer versions available; not upgraded here (optional peers degrade gracefully; a
peer-bump is its own effort). No HIGH/CRITICAL findings to address.

### Added

- **Extensible tensor-axis type system (rank-N, consumer-driven) — the scaffolding
  for expanding UPT into many more branches of physics.** New `src/composition/axes.ts`
  is the single source for the classification axes: each is a typed union AND an
  `AxisSpec` registry entry, so adding an axis is one union + one registry line. The
  discovery falsifier now derives `GATE_AXES` from the registry (`AXES.filter(gated)`)
  instead of a hardcoded list. Two axes were typed and wired into `RegimeAttributes`:
  the previously-**untyped Topology axis** (`trivial | chern | winding | z2 | berry`)
  and a genuinely new 7th axis, **Quantum Statistics** (`bosonic | fermionic | anyonic
  | parastatistic`) — condensed matter and particle physics both need it and it does
  not reduce to the other six. Symmetry also became a first-class attribute.
  - **The anti-inert-metadata gate is executable, not asserted:** new
    `axis-audit.ts` (`auditAxisDiscrimination`) measures, per axis, how often it FIRES
    (clashes) vs ABSTAINS over the discovery funnel. An axis stays **ungated** until
    the measurement shows it discriminates. Confirmed: scale/force fire (75/29
    clashes) → gated; symmetry/topology/statistics have `checked=0` (thin coverage) →
    correctly ungated. **Rank grows on measured evidence, not vision.**
  - Two sourced attribute tags demonstrate the wiring (`topological-entanglement-
    entropy` → topology `z2`; `dark-fermion-mass` → statistics `fermionic`), routed
    through the attribute-audit governance pin. The SI `Dimension` axis stays
    separate (the complete 7-base system in `dimensional/`; conflating it would break
    Buckingham-π). Design:
    `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-05-extensible-tensor-axis-system-design.md`.

- **Four new ESTABLISHED, data-confrontable bridges (BE-55…58) — catalog 44 → 48,
  evidence spine 9 → 12.** A PI audit found the catalog was 82% speculative and the
  rank-6 tensor's **Topology axis nearly empty**; these rebalance it toward
  falsifiable physics. Each is textbook physics, primary-source-grounded, and
  passed the adversarial Adam/Eve physics vet (2026-07-05):
  - **BE-55 — integer quantum Hall / TKNN** (σ_xy = C·e²/h; topology ↔ transport).
    **Populates the Topology axis.** Confronted on UNIVERSALITY, not the (post-2019
    definitional) value: graphene vs GaAs quantized Hall resistance agree to
    8.6×10⁻¹¹ (Janssen 2012) — a non-circular test of the topological quantization.
    Vet GREEN/GREEN.
  - **BE-56 — Casimir effect** (F/A = −π²ℏc/240d⁴; quantum vacuum ↔ classical
    force). Confronted vs the corrected theory to ~1% (Mohideen-Roy 1998); the
    provenance records Eve's caveat that it is systematics-dominated, not a clean
    test of the ideal coefficient. Vet GREEN(Adam)/YELLOW(Eve).
  - **BE-57 — Unruh effect** (T = ℏa/2πck_B; acceleration ↔ quantum-thermal).
    Hawking's kinematic sibling. CONFRONTATION DEFERRED — lab T~4×10⁻²⁰ K is
    unmeasurable (honest, not in DATA_CONFRONTED_IDS). Vet DEFER/DEFER.
  - **BE-58 — Johnson-Nyquist / fluctuation-dissipation** (S_V = 4k_BTR; thermal ↔
    electrical). The established theorem the catalog's BE-27 (active-matter FDT
    violation) violates. Confronted via NIST Johnson Noise Thermometry: k_B
    measured through the noise agrees with CODATA at 0.81σ (Flowers-Jacobs 2017) —
    independent (resistance traceable to the quantum Hall effect, T to acoustic
    thermometry). Vet GREEN/GREEN. (Verification caught + fixed a 10× σ error:
    residual 8.1σ → 0.81σ.)

  Closed-form evaluators (BE-51/52 pattern, no AST round-trip); the reviewer MCP
  tools disconnected mid-task and reconnected, so the vet ran before encoding.
  Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-05-four-established-bridges-design.md`.

- **API.md — the canonical-equation registry (L-layer) API is now documented.**
  Closed a pre-existing gap (predated v0.28): the ~16 runtime + 7 type exports of
  the canonical registry (`CANONICAL_EQUATIONS`, `CANONICAL_BY_ID`,
  `canonicalById`/`canonicalByDomain`, `partneredBridgeIds`/
  `bridgesWithoutCanonicalPartner`, `canonicalToLaw`/`seedCanonicalLaws`,
  `CANONICAL_GRAPH`/`canonicalToEdges`/`CANONICAL_CONSTANTS`, `normalForm`/
  `structurallyEqual`, `classifyLinkage`/`scanLinkages`, and the
  `CanonicalEquation`/`CanonicalDomain`/`EpistemicStatus`/`CanonicalForms`/
  `FieldEquationNode`/`LinkageResult`/`RecoveryOutcome` types) now have a §12
  section. Every symbol verified present in `src/index.ts`.

### Assessed — not adopted

- **`@vercel/ncc` (danielsimonjr/ncc fork) evaluated as a UPT build tool — NOT
  adopted.** Empirical test: `ncc build` on the CLI entry produced a **5.6 MB,
  19-file bundle** for a zero-hard-dependency library, **inlined the OPTIONAL
  peers** (`@viz-js/viz` WASM + `mathts-*`) that UPT's architecture requires to
  stay external and degrade gracefully, and the **bundle did not run**. ncc is
  built for CLIs/serverless with heavy dependency trees; UPT is a zero-dep ESM
  library with subpath exports, a full `.d.ts` type surface, and optional-peer
  graceful degradation — all of which bundling destroys. `tsc → dist/` remains the
  correct build. No change to the build pipeline.

### Changed

- **Regenerated the dependency-graph reports (DGT) and corrected stale hand-written
  architecture counts.** A bird's-eye codebase audit via `npm run docs:deps`: the
  code is structurally clean — **0 circular dependencies** (runtime + type-only),
  **0 unused files, 0 unused exports**, **98.3%** test coverage (232/236 source
  files; the 4 without direct tests are all `_`-prefixed internal helpers, covered
  transitively). Current shape: 239 TypeScript files, 48.6k LOC, 1578 exports
  across 10 modules. Fixed concrete stale counts in `ARCHITECTURE.md` /
  `COMPONENTS.md` that had drifted (canonical equations 66 → 103; source files 187
  → 239; per-module `bridges/` 57 → 67, `composition/` 31 → 45, `dimensional/` 29
  → 31; real-data confrontations 3 → 9). NOTE: the five core architecture docs
  (ARCHITECTURE, COMPONENTS, OVERVIEW, API, DATAFLOW) remain ~12 releases behind in
  NARRATIVE (the v0.28–v0.40 program is not yet written into their prose) — a
  dedicated narrative refresh is a tracked follow-up, distinct from these count
  corrections.
- **Architecture-docs NARRATIVE refresh (the tracked follow-up, now done).** The
  five core architecture docs (ARCHITECTURE, COMPONENTS, OVERVIEW, API, DATAFLOW)
  were ~12 releases behind in prose; refreshed to reflect the v0.28–v0.40 program
  — the CLI overhaul (typed `src/cli/` port), discovery-hardening, the `upt
  confront` evidence spine (9 confrontations), the epistemic-grounding ledger, the
  canonical L-layer's growth to 103, and the PI-instrument reframing. New content:
  OVERVIEW's per-release narrative through v0.40; ARCHITECTURE's v0.28–v0.40
  system-overview + a `cli/` module row + corrected Key Statistics/test stats;
  COMPONENTS sections for the confront/grounding/CLI subsystems; API entries for
  the new `@public` confrontation + grounding + consequence exports (each verified
  against `src/index.ts`); DATAFLOW Flow 10 (confront) + Flow 11 (discovery +
  grounding). The stale `**Version**`/`**Last Updated**` header pins were removed
  from all five (per the no-version/date-in-design-docs convention). Refreshed by
  five parallel agents under a no-fabrication mandate; lead-reviewed against
  source/CLI (two agent misses — stale test stats + an overview count — caught and
  fixed).

## [0.40.0] — 2026-07-04

An honesty-hardening release from a PI review of the evidence spine's rigor.
`upt confront` now surfaces the BE-36 one-sided caveat (a pass that tested only
half of an asymmetric bound no longer reads as a clean two-sided one), and the
research/architecture docs record the spine's honest shape — precision GR at
~10⁻⁵ across two independent PPN parameters, not nine equal confirmations.

### Changed

- **`upt confront` now surfaces the BE-36 one-sided caveat in the summary line.**
  The GW170817 speed confrontation passes on the POSITIVE side only: BE-36's
  symmetric encoded bound (|Δc/c| ≤ 10⁻¹⁵) is consistent with the observed +side
  (+6.5×10⁻¹⁶), but the observed −side (−3.1×10⁻¹⁵) exceeds it. The one-liner
  previously read a clean "not excluded ✓"; it now appends "one-sided: +side only
  (…)", and the `upper-bound` outcome carries an optional `caveat` field (also in
  `--json`). An honesty fix surfaced by a PI review of the evidence spine's rigor
  — the caveat already lived in the provenance note, but not in the summary a
  reader skims, so a one-sided pass could read as a clean two-sided one.

Dep-health at release: `npm audit` 0 vulnerabilities; no hard deps; the outdated
optional `mathts-*` peers remain deliberately untaken (they degrade gracefully).
Suite green: 3600 passing / 334 files; dep graph clean (0 cycles, 0 unused files,
0 unused exports, 98.3% coverage); 103 canonical equations, 9 data-confronted
bridges. Docs refreshed (README, research, architecture) to the current state.

## [0.39.0] — 2026-07-04

Evidence spine 8 → 9 — and an honesty save. Grows the spine with the **BE-11
collisional-decoherence confrontation** (matter-wave interferometry), notable
less for the confrontation than for what the vet caught: both adversarial
reviewers confidently returned FABRICATED cross-sections, and fetching the actual
arXiv paper exposed them. The reviewer-disagreement → verify-primary-source rule
held, and no fabricated number reached the catalog.

### Added

- **BE-11 collisional-decoherence confrontation** (evidence spine 8 → 9).
  Confronts the Lindblad decoherence master equation with the collisional
  decoherence of C70 fullerenes in a Talbot-Lau interferometer (Hornberger et al.
  2003, PRL 90:160401): the **parameter-free** decoherence-theory prediction of
  the decoherence pressure p₀ reproduces the measured p₀ across **9 background
  gases** (H₂…Xe, N₂, CH₄; masses and interaction strengths spanning ~2 orders of
  magnitude) within the **~15% experimental uncertainty**. A `consistency`-kind
  confrontation (agreement within error, BE-23 style), not a precise residual —
  the paper confronts theory vs experiment in a figure, so only the paper's
  explicit stated agreement is encoded.
  - **Honesty note (a primary-source save):** the Adam/Eve number-sourcing pass
    returned two DIFFERENT, and on check FABRICATED, cross-section pairs (490/510
    Å² and 420/400 Å²) that do not appear in the paper — their "Table I" is the
    van der Waals C₆ parameters, not a confrontation. Fetching and reading the
    arXiv source (quant-ph/0303093) caught this: the real observable is the p₀
    figure and the numbers here are verified against the source, not the
    reviewers. The reviewer-disagreement → verify-primary-source rule worked as
    designed.

Dep-health at release: `npm audit` 0 vulnerabilities; no hard deps; the outdated
optional `mathts-*` peers remain deliberately untaken (they degrade gracefully).
Suite green: 3598 passing / 334 files; dep graph clean (0 cycles, 0 unused files,
0 unused exports, 98.3% coverage); 103 canonical equations, 9 data-confronted
bridges.

## [0.38.0] — 2026-07-04

Evidence-spine growth over decoy graph edges. Asked to "build the connectors", the
honest answer was **0 of 7 genuine** (the isolated-bridge frontier is isolated by
physics, not vocabulary) — so instead the evidence spine grew with a real
theory-vs-data confrontation: **BE-35, the conformal bootstrap vs the measured 3D
Ising critical exponent** (spine 7 → 8). Both deliverables ran through the Adam+Eve
firewall.

### Added

- **BE-35 conformal-bootstrap confrontation** (evidence spine 7 → 8). Confronts
  the bridge's flagship consequence — the 3D Ising universality-class critical
  exponent — against experiment: the conformal-bootstrap prediction **ν =
  0.629971(4)** (Kos, Poland, Simmons-Duffin & Vichi 2016, via Δ_ε = 1.412625)
  agrees with the **measured ν = 0.630(2)** at real 3D-Ising critical points
  (liquid-vapor / binary-fluid systems; Pelissetto & Vicari 2002) at **0.015σ**,
  within 1σ. A value-kind confrontation; the observed value is an INDEPENDENT lab
  measurement, not a recompute. Honesty guards (Adam+Eve vet, both GREEN): the
  Monte-Carlo value (Hasenbusch 2010) was deliberately NOT used for the observed
  slot — bootstrap-vs-MC is theory-vs-theory, not a data confrontation; and the
  provenance records that experimental precision (±0.002) is far coarser than the
  bootstrap (±0.000004), so this confirms consistency rather than stress-testing
  the bootstrap. First confrontation grown after the 0/7 connector adjudication
  (the "better option": real data over decoy graph edges).

### Changed

- **Orphan-connector adjudication extended to 0 of 7 genuine** (Round 2,
  `docs/research/orphan-connector-adjudication.md`). Ran the four most-motivated
  same-kind connector candidates — the ones with a real theoretical story, not
  generic decoys — through the Adam+Eve firewall under the strict "same physical
  quantity (true alias)" bar: the Ryu–Takayanagi ≟ Bekenstein–Hawking holographic
  entropy pair (both S=A/4G), the ER=EPR wormhole-entropy pair, attempt-frequency
  ≟ Debye-frequency, and gravitational-wave-speed ≟ c. **Unanimous DECOY on all
  four** — the S=A/4G pair is "equality without identity" (a shared law, not the
  same quantity; same ruling as the BE-29 Landauer form-coincidence), and v_GW ≟ c
  is a testable GR prediction, not a definition. No `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS`
  entry added — the isolated-bridge frontier is isolated by physics, not
  vocabulary. This is the honest outcome of "build the connectors": run through the
  firewall, there is nothing genuine to encode. Flagship note + research index
  updated to the 0/7 total.

Dep-health at release: `npm audit` 0 vulnerabilities; no hard deps; the outdated
optional `mathts-*` peers remain deliberately untaken (they degrade gracefully).
Suite green: 3595 passing / 333 files; dep graph clean (0 cycles, 0 unused files,
0 unused exports, 98.3% coverage); 103 canonical equations, 8 data-confronted
bridges.

## [0.37.0] — 2026-07-04

The **PI-instrument program** — reframing the framework as an honest
falsification instrument a scientist can stake a claim on (a trustworthy *no*, an
extraordinary *yes*). Two features shipped; three phases resolved to honest
not-build / boundary / defer (mechanism-tier and propose→confront loop are not
buildable on dimensional candidates without fabrication; BE-53 deferred). The
flagship PI-facing results note (`docs/research/pi-instrument-results.md`) and the
regenerated architecture maps consolidate the null-result catalog, the evidence
spine (now 7 confrontations), and the frontier.

### Added

- **PI-instrument Phase 4 — BE-21 KSS viscosity-bound confrontation**
  (data-confronted bridges 6 → 7). Confronts the bridge's KSS universal lower
  bound η/s ≥ ℏ/(4π k_B) = 1/(4π) ≈ 0.0796 (in ℏ/k_B units) against the
  quark-gluon plasma — the "most perfect fluid" — whose Bayesian-extracted η/s
  (Bernhard, Moreland & Bass 2019, Nature Phys. 15:1113; band ≈ 0.08–0.15,
  representative ~0.10) **satisfies and nearly saturates** the bound (~26%
  above). A `consistency`-kind confrontation, honest about the
  temperature-dependent extraction band and Eve's caveat that the band's lower
  edge approaches the bound; the observed value is an independent hydrodynamic
  extraction, not a recompute of 1/(4π). **BE-53 (Yang-Mills β vs α_s running)
  deliberately deferred:** the Adam/Eve data vet rejected a numeric b₀ extraction
  as fabrication (it ignores charm/bottom flavor thresholds and higher-loop
  running); the honest sign-of-running confrontation (α_s runs down ⇒ β<0) is
  real physics but does not map to the quantitative value/bound/consistency
  outcome kinds without a proper multi-threshold QCD running code — documented as
  a Phase-4 boundary, not force-fit. Phase 2 (mechanism tier) was a documented
  NOT-BUILD (a mechanism-proxy gate beyond axis-compatibility is not buildable
  without fabricating coupling physics the catalog lacks).
- **PI-instrument Phase 1 — the epistemic-grounding ledger on discovery
  verdicts.** Every `promising` candidate in `upt discover` (and each candidate
  under `--json`) now carries a `grounding` record making the verdict's
  provenance legible for a scientist: which falsifiers actually **passed** (ran a
  real comparison and the candidate survived) vs the **gaps** (gates that
  abstained, or an unadjudicated result), plus the honest **ceiling** (no
  mechanism test — axis-compatibility is a proxy — and no data confrontation).
  Load-bearing honesty guards (vet-mandated): a `novel-consequence` is a **gap**
  (an unadjudicated machine guess), never a passed test; magnitude and axis are
  **not** collapsed into a single "tier" (orthogonal evidence); an anchor-derived
  magnitude value is flagged as weaker; axis is reported as partial (`≥1 regime
  axis`). Pure derived function `describeGrounding` over each candidate's
  existing falsifier results — **annotation-only**: no verdict, score, or funnel
  count changes (the calibration benchmark is unmoved). First phase of the
  PI-instrument program (grounding → mechanism tier → propose→confront loop →
  evidence spine → frontier output); design + Adam/Eve vet:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-pi-instrument-phase1-grounding-tier-design.md`.

## [0.36.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added

- **L1-sum tier completed — 5 more non-monomial canonical laws** (registry
  98 → 103), the harder backlog that stresses the grammar (a fractional
  exponent, transcendental cos/sin, dimensionless integer counts), filling the
  **special-relativity and optics gaps** that had zero canonical entries: the
  **Lorentz factor** γ = (1 − v²/c²)^{−½} (encoded directly via a `−0.5` literal
  exponent on the dimensionless 1 − β² base — no squared-form workaround needed),
  the **Compton wavelength shift** Δλ = (h/mc)(1 − cos θ), the **Rydberg formula**
  1/λ = R(1/n₁² − 1/n₂²), **Snell's law** (solved for the refracted index), and
  **Malus's law** I = I₀ cos²θ. Each built via `l1()` so the L0 fields are
  engine-derived (`monomial:null` + `freeGroups ≥ 1`; the F1 self-consistency
  invariant holds unchanged), with the exact form in the `scalarAst`. **Honest
  scope (measured):** all 5 produce ZERO structural bridge-matches, same as the
  first 5 — the value is reference-completeness of the canonical L-layer, not
  bridge-validation. The non-monomial reference now holds **10 famous laws**.

Dep-health at release: `npm audit` 0 vulnerabilities; no hard deps; optional
`mathts-*` peers + in-range `@types/node`/`js-yaml` bumps deliberately untaken.
Suite green: 3579 passing / 330 files; 103 canonical equations.

## [0.35.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Canonical L1-sum tier — the first non-monomial canonical laws** (registry
  93 → 98). Encodes 5 famous laws whose RHS is a genuine sum or transcendental,
  which the monomial L0 layer could not represent: Bernoulli, radioactive decay
  (`N₀e^{−λt}`), the photoelectric equation (`hf − W`), Carnot efficiency
  (`1 − T_c/T_h`), and the Boltzmann factor (`e^{−E/k_BT}`). Each carries a full
  L1 `scalarAst`, dimensionally validated (sum summands share a dimension;
  transcendental args are dimensionless), with engine-derived `monomial:null` +
  `freeGroups ≥ 1` — the classic "dimensionally underdetermined" state, so the
  existing F1 self-consistency invariant holds unchanged. **Honest scope:** a
  measurement found these produce ZERO structural bridge-matches today — `upt
  recover` scans them (its `normalForm` is sum/transcendental-aware) but no
  catalog bridge is Bernoulli/decay-shaped — so the value is **reference-
  completeness of the canonical L-layer, not bridge-validation**, stated without
  inflation. The **L2 field-equation tier (Maxwell/Schrödinger) was deliberately
  NOT built**: its node type is Einstein-only and `fieldEquation` is read by
  nothing but a CLI label — the inert-metadata trap. (Design + Adam/Eve vet +
  measurement: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-l1-sum-tier-design.md`.)
- **BE-51 gravitational-lensing confrontation — the third classic test of
  general relativity** (data-confronted bridges 5 → 6). Confronts the bridge's
  own solar light-deflection prediction (`evaluateGravitationalLensing`,
  α = 4GM/(bc²) ≈ 1.752″ at the solar limb) against the modern VLBI
  determination of the PPN parameter γ (Lambert & Le Poncin-Lafitte 2009,
  A&A 499:331; γ − 1 = (−0.8 ± 1.2)×10⁻⁴) — **within 1σ (residual ≈ 0.67σ)**.
  Joins be-52 (Mercury perihelion, 0.26σ) and be-37 (Shapiro delay, 0.91σ):
  the framework now reproduces all three classic GR tests within error, each
  computed from the bridge's own formula. Tests γ via light *deflection*,
  complementary to be-37's γ via Shapiro *delay* (same PPN parameter, two
  independent experiments). Surfaced live by `upt confront`; the observed value
  is honestly the VLBI-measured γ applied to the constant solar-limb baseline
  (provenance-documented, not a reproduction of the bridge's formula).

Dep-health at release: `npm audit` 0 vulnerabilities; no hard deps; the optional
`mathts-*` peers + `@types/node`/`js-yaml` in-range bumps remain deliberately
untaken (graceful degradation unaffected). Suite green: 3566 passing / 330 files;
98 canonical equations; 6 data-confronted bridges.

## [0.34.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Canonical L-layer expansion: 66 → 93 equations (27 new monomial laws,
  +41%).** The textbook ground-truth L-layer — the reference the bridge catalog
  is validated against — grows across a new `condensed-matter` domain
  (Drude/Fermi/Hall — 9 laws) plus fluids (4), electromagnetism (5),
  thermodynamics (3), statistical mechanics (4, in a new
  `statistical-mechanics.ts`), and mechanics/quantum (harmonic-oscillator
  energy, Thomson cross-section). Every entry is engine-validated as a unique
  dimensional monomial (`freeDimensionlessGroups = 0`) with a real citation and
  an honest `epistemicStatus` (fully-quantitative / scalar-up-to-constant /
  dimensional). Domain counts: mechanics 25→30, electromagnetism 13→18,
  statistical 2→6, thermodynamics 4→7, quantum 11→12, condensed-matter 0→9.
- **The monomial L0 model's boundaries, mapped and documented.** The encoding
  established exactly which textbook laws the dimensional L0 layer can and
  cannot hold. Deliberately EXCLUDED (not force-fit) and logged as a future
  L1-sum / L2 field-equation backlog: sums/differences (Bernoulli, Carnot,
  photoelectric), transcendentals (radioactive decay, Planck's law, Snell,
  Compton), **hidden multiple length scales** (Poiseuille `r⁴/L`, Fourier
  conduction `A/L²`), **dimensionless numbers** (Reynolds, fine-structure α,
  refractive index — the exponent is unpinnable by dimensions), and **pure
  counts** (nuclear `N`, mass number `A`). Geometric optics has zero monomial
  representatives; special relativity's γ-laws sit in the backlog. Full
  classification: `docs/research/canonical-expansion-candidate-audit.md`.
- **Machine-readable artifact v2 (P10 collaboration surface).**
  `data/bridge-catalog.json` now carries the discovery review surfaces
  alongside the 44-bridge catalog: a `confrontations` array (the 5 committed
  real-data confrontations with their predicted-vs-observed outcomes) and an
  `adjudications` array (the human verdict ledger). `schemaVersion` 1 → 2,
  schema updated, and `tests/bridges/catalog-json.test.ts` now pins both new
  sections against the live registries (drift guard). A collaborator can
  consume UPT's findings — catalog + empirical spine + verdicts — from one
  versioned JSON without running the CLI or building the TypeScript.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/emit-catalog-json.mjs` could not regenerate the artifact on
  Windows.** It `import()`ed an absolute `C:\…` path, which modern Node's ESM
  loader rejects (`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`) — the reason the committed
  artifact had been stuck at `packageVersion 0.10.0`. Now converts the dist
  path to a `file://` URL via `pathToFileURL` before import.

## [0.33.0] — 2026-07-03

Evidence channels + mechanism-sensitive discovery: the `upt confront`
real-data confrontation subsystem (data-confronted bridges 3 → 5) and the
consequence-propagation annotation layer (the machine pre-classifier for the
adjudication ledger), plus the dependency-graph tooling hardening. Phases 3
and 4-Unit-A shipped together in this release (neither was tagged separately).

`wanted` bumps deliberately not taken (`@types/node` 26.1.0, `js-yaml` 5.2.1,
several `mathts-*` patches); the optional `mathts-*` peers have newer majors —
graceful degradation unaffected.

### Changed

- Phase-2 deferred minors closed: `rankDiscoveries` and `VettedCandidate`
  now carry `@public` JSDoc tags matching their v0.32.0 root export;
  `discover.ts`'s adjudication-annotation ternary reads positive-condition
  first (behavior-identical, golden-verified); the calibration benchmark's
  70+10=80 would-clash decomposition (70 `axis-clash` verdicts + 10 shadowed
  by `magnitude-clash` precedence) is now a machine assertion instead of a
  comment-only claim.

### Added

- **Discovery-hardening Phase 4 Unit A: consequence-propagation annotation.**
  `src/composition/consequence.ts` is a POST-PASS annotator over ranked
  candidates (mirrors `annotateAdjudications`): for each `promising`
  candidate it reuses `deriveProposedBridges` to derive the identification's
  monomial algebraic consequence, then compares its `normalForm` against the
  canonical registry (same target AND same governing set) to label the
  candidate `entailed` (re-derives known physics), `novel-consequence` (valid,
  no canonical match), or `inconclusive` (no monomial consequence derivable).
  There is no `consequence-invalid` signal — Task-0 measurement showed it
  fires on nothing, so it was cut before implementation. Annotation-only:
  the underlying `ProposedBridge` stays `status:'unadjudicated'`, and the
  funnel's promising/inert/contradictory counts are unchanged (the standing
  `discovery-calibration.test.ts` benchmark pins this — verified
  byte-identical). Task-0 measured yield: 0 entailed / 4 novel-consequence
  across the catalog + canonical graphs — every `promising` candidate so far
  is either genuinely new or too algebraically thin to classify, none merely
  restates a textbook equation. `upt discover` surfaces the signal as a
  `[consequence: …]` trailer on each promising line (text) and a
  `consequence` field per candidate (`--json`). `annotateConsequences` is
  generic over its input candidate type (`<T extends VettedCandidate>`) so it
  composes with `annotateAdjudications`'s output without losing fields.
  `annotateConsequences`, `classifyProposal`, and the `ConsequenceSignal` /
  `ConsequenceEvidence` / `ConsequenceAnnotatedCandidate` types are exported
  from `src/index.ts` as genuine public API. Unit B (bounded Buckingham-π
  consequence propagation) is deferred pending a representative-values
  expansion and stays queued in `todo.md`.

- **`upt confront` — real-data confrontation subsystem (data-confronted
  bridges 3 → 5).** A typed observation layer (`src/bridges/observations/types.ts`:
  provenance-mandatory `ObservationProvenance`, named `SigmaComponent[]` +
  `combineInQuadrature` for root-sum-square uncertainty, `residualInSigma`)
  backs a normalized `ConfrontationOutcome`, discriminated on `kind`
  (`value` / `upper-bound` / `consistency` / `table`) so each confrontation
  carries only the fields it can honestly populate. The new
  `CONFRONTATIONS` registry (`src/bridges/confrontations.ts`,
  `listConfrontations`/`runConfrontation`) wraps the existing be-23/36/52
  confrontations plus two new ones behind this unified shape:
  - **be-37 × Cassini** (`confrontBE37`/`CASSINI`) — BE-37's γ=1 GR Shapiro
    prediction vs the Cassini radio-link PPN-γ measurement
    (Bertotti, Iess & Tortora 2003, Nature 425:374).
  - **be-48 × LISA-Pathfinder** (`confrontBE48`/`LISA_PATHFINDER_CSL`) —
    BE-48's GRW single-nucleon collapse rate vs the CSL upper bound
    (Carlesso et al. 2016, PRD 95:084054 / arXiv:1606.03637); a
    fail-to-exclude (~8 orders below the bound), not a confirmation.
  - New CLI command `upt confront [--bridge=be-XX] [--json]` prints
    predicted-vs-observed for every registered confrontation (or one, via
    `--bridge`), always carrying the "confrontation is consistency, not
    confirmation" epistemics line.
  - `--sensitivity` adds a dimensionless elasticity ranking
    (`decidingMeasurement`, central-difference `|∂P/∂xᵢ|·xᵢ/P`) of a
    value-kind confrontation's inputs — which input the prediction depends
    on most STRONGLY, not which dominates the uncertainty budget.

  **be-16 Landauer/Bérut** (`consistency`-kind machinery built, Fig-4
  asymptote value from Bérut 2012 paywalled), **be-23's per-material α
  table** (aggregate confrontation already shipped; per-material rows from
  Legros 2019 paywalled), and **be-38 MOND/SPARC deep-limit** (contingent
  on a genuine-test-vs-a₀-reproduction determination) remain queued in
  `todo.md`, data-pending.

- Direct test coverage for the 4 DGT-flagged runtime files (+42 tests):
  the full 6-axis × law/bridge/emergence Rule-4 regime-consistency matrix
  (`regime-rule-install`), exact builtin displayName/provenance pins
  (`regimes-builtins`), first-ever coverage for the A/B/C validator
  dispatch registry (`validator-registry`), and the FormulaError seam
  cases on the MathTS parser adapter (`formula-mathts`, peer-gated).
  3 of the 4 flags turned out to be DGT attribution false positives
  (side-effect imports / filename mismatch) — evidence recorded for the
  DGT tool-improvement task; only `validator-registry.ts` was genuinely
  uncovered.

### Fixed

- **Dependency-graph tool: 4 false-positive classes in the coverage/unused
  reports.** (a) `.d.ts` declaration files no longer count in the
  test-coverage denominator; (b) exported types referenced only by a
  same-file exported signature (e.g. `SourceName` in `resolveGraph`'s
  return type) are no longer flagged unused; (c) side-effect imports with
  trailing comments and test-file dynamic `import()` now credit coverage;
  (d) multi-line named-import blocks with interior `//` comment lines no
  longer garble the identifiers that follow (this was why
  `lowerBianchiResidual` — genuinely imported by `lowering.ts` — was
  flagged unused). Net: untested files 26 → 18, unused exports 8 → 0, with
  structural graph metrics verified byte-identical. A 5th pre-existing
  class (JSDoc `@example` import snippets scanned as real imports) is
  documented in todo.md, not yet fixed.

### Removed

- Dead `allCommands()` removed from `src/cli/command.ts` (CLI-internal, never
  re-exported from `cli-api.ts`/`index.ts`; zero call sites since the v0.30
  port — `runCli` dispatches via `resolveCommand` only). The DGT diagnosis
  flagged 3 "dead exports"; grep re-verification showed the other two are
  live (`SourceName` is referenced by `resolveGraph`'s exported signature,
  `lowerBianchiResidual` is imported by `numerical/lowering.ts`) and they are
  kept.

## [0.32.0] — 2026-07-02

Discovery-hardening Phase 2: the funnel gets an axis-compatibility falsifier,
and `map`/`connectors` stop hiding the canonical graph by default. Dep-health
at release: `npm audit` 0 vulnerabilities; no hard deps; in-range wanted bumps
available but deliberately not taken this release (`@types/node` 26.1.0,
`js-yaml` 5.2.1, several `mathts-*` wanted patches); the optional `mathts-*`
peers have newer majors — graceful degradation unaffected.

### Added

- **Axis-compatibility falsifier — new `'axis-clash'` verdict.** A discovery
  candidate is an identification (`a ≡ b`, one quantity under two names), so
  its stated `scale`/`force` regime attributes must agree; a genuine
  disagreement on either axis now falsifies the candidate instead of letting
  it read as `promising`. Either side silent on an axis — including a
  fold-conflict among `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS` contributors — abstains
  rather than clashing (`compose.ts`'s `effectiveAttributes`, the single
  shared fold resolver); `information` stays annotation-only, never gates.
  Verdict precedence is `magnitude-clash → contradictory → axis-clash →
  promising/inert`; `axisChecked`/`axisClashes` are populated on every
  candidate regardless of which falsifier ultimately wins, so no verdict
  shadows another's diagnostic. Resolution is **registry-only** (Option A):
  the gate reads centralized `Quantity.attributes` and never the canonical
  L-layer's per-equation regime stamps, and folds through
  `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS` with conflict-as-abstain rather than clash.
- **Adjudicated regime-attribute audit (59-row governance pin).** Applied the
  binding Adam+Eve adjudication over the full existing attribute surface: 4
  strips — `mass` and `temperature` (generics that span classical and
  quantum regimes; a fold-consistency test fails on both) drop to `{}`, and
  `decoherence-rate`/`relaxation-rate` drop their `scale` (adjudicator split
  → abstain) — plus 5 completions gaining a missing axis
  (`boundary-entanglement-entropy`, `mass-density`,
  `wormhole-entanglement-entropy` → `force: gravitational`;
  `donor-acceptor-distance`, `foerster-radius` — the FRET dipole-dipole pair
  → `force: electromagnetic`). `boundary-length`'s proposed completion was
  reviewed and rejected (it belongs to the BE-22 topological-entanglement-
  entropy family, not the RT/horizon one) and is unchanged.
- `VettedCandidate` and `rankDiscoveries` are now exported from the package
  root (`src/index.ts`), alongside the adjudication ledger already exported
  in v0.31.0 — package-root consumers can now build `annotateAdjudications`'s
  input via public API without reaching into `src/composition/discovery.js`.

### Changed

- **`upt map` and `upt connectors` now default to `--source=both`.** Both
  commands ask pure connectivity questions, so hiding the canonical graph by
  default was misleading; they now show catalog + canonical together unless
  `--source=catalog` is given explicitly (still fully supported and
  golden-covered). `discover` and the other 6 `--source`-bearing commands are
  unchanged — they keep the `catalog` default.
- **`upt discover`'s funnel line and CLI output gain the axis-clash verdict.**
  The funnel summary now reports `· N axis-clash` alongside the existing
  buckets, and a new AXIS-CLASH section ("identification falsified (stated
  regimes differ)") lists the falsified pairs with their disagreeing axes.
  `--json` gains the corresponding fields; `discover --derive` is unaffected
  (`annotateAdjudications` no longer even runs on that path — see Fixed).
- **Catalog `promising` count drops 12 → 7.** The 5 pairs that flip to
  `axis-clash` are dimensional coincidences whose registry-stated regimes
  actually differ: `boundary-length ≟ schwarzschild-radius`,
  `coarsening-length ≟ schwarzschild-radius`, `coarsening-length ≟
  thermal-wavelength`, `grw-localization-rate ≟ hubble-rate`,
  `grw-localization-rate ≟ mutation-rate`. `mass ≟ scalar-field-{reference,
  value}` were a pre-audit collateral flip that the `mass` generic-strip
  reverses — they stay `promising`, not falsified.
- **`upt predict` placements reflect the audit.** `mass` and `temperature`
  are now unplaceable (their attributes are `{}`, so `placeQuantity` can no
  longer regime-key them); the two FRET quantities
  (`donor-acceptor-distance`, `foerster-radius`) gain an electromagnetic
  placement. The `predict` golden moved from 40/41 edges onto 20 linked pairs
  to 39/41 edges onto 14.
- **TypeScript:** `VettedCandidate['verdict']` gained the `'axis-clash'`
  member. Any downstream exhaustive `switch` over `verdict` needs a new arm.

### Fixed

- **Canonical projection silently dropped the information axis.** The
  canonical regime used camelCase `InformationMeasure` values (`vonNeumann`,
  `shannon`, `kolmogorov`, `quantumDiscord`) while `RegimeAttributes.
  information` uses kebab-case (`von-neumann`, `shannon`, `kolmogorov`,
  `discord`), so the enum mismatch meant the axis never projected onto
  canonical-graph edges. `canonical-graph.ts`'s `attributesOf` now maps
  between the two spellings explicitly.
- **`upt discover --derive` no longer runs `annotateAdjudications` on output
  it discards.** The `--derive` path feeds `deriveProposedBridges(ranked)`
  and never used the annotated array; it's now only computed on the
  non-derive path (closes the deferred minor from the v0.31.0 wrap).

## [0.31.0] — 2026-07-02

Discovery-hardening Phase 1: the funnel gets review memory. Dep-health at
release: `npm audit` 0 vulnerabilities; no hard deps; in-range wanted bumps
available but deliberately not taken this release (`@types/node` 26.1.0,
`js-yaml` 5.2.1, several `mathts-*` wanted patches); the optional `mathts-*`
peers have newer majors — graceful degradation unaffected.

### Added

- **Discovery-hardening program plan (docs only — no behavior change).** The
  10 improvement proposals toward the bridge-discovery goal, ordered into 6
  releases (v0.31.0–v0.36.0) with program invariants (epistemic firewall,
  benchmark-gated funnel changes):
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-discovery-hardening-program-design.md`.
  Phase 1 (adjudication ledger + calibration benchmark) has an executable,
  Adam+Eve-vetted (YELLOW×2, findings folded) subagent-ready plan:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-02-discovery-hardening-phase1.md`.
- **Discovery-hardening Phase 1: adjudication ledger + calibration benchmark.**
  `src/composition/adjudication.ts` seeds the 8 verdicts from this session's
  two Adam+Eve adjudication passes (`docs/research/proposed-equations-
  adjudication.md`, `docs/research/orphan-connector-adjudication.md`) as a
  code-level ledger (`candidateId`, `ADJUDICATIONS`, `adjudicationFor`,
  `annotateAdjudications`), keyed by an order-normalized quantity-name pair;
  verdicts annotate discovery output only and never mutate the catalog or
  graphs (the epistemic firewall). `tests/composition/discovery-calibration.
  test.ts` is the standing regression gate pinning funnel counts and all 8
  seeded verdicts. The ledger's 7 symbols (`candidateId`, `AdjudicationVerdict`,
  `CandidateAdjudication`, `ADJUDICATIONS`, `adjudicationFor`,
  `AnnotatedCandidate`, `annotateAdjudications`) are exported from `src/index.ts`
  as genuine public API, so it is machine-consumable outside the CLI.

### Changed

- **`upt discover` folds adjudicated candidates.** PROMISING candidates
  carrying a recorded `decoy`/`entailed` verdict fold out of the default
  printed list (review memory, not a re-litigation prompt); `deferred`/
  `genuine` verdicts stay listed with an `[adjudicated: …]` trailer. A
  reconciling `adjudicated: N of the M promising carry recorded verdicts …`
  line prints when any of the list carries a verdict, and `--show-adjudicated`
  re-lists the folded candidates. `--json` gains additive fields only: each
  candidate may carry `adjudication`, and the envelope gains a top-level
  `adjudicationSummary` — both new, existing fields unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Dep-graph tool: dist→src coverage attribution.** Tests that exercise the
  built package (the CLI suite imports `dist/cli/*.js` in-process) resolved to
  paths matching no source file, so all of `src/cli/` was falsely reported
  untested (84.8%) and `cli-api.ts`/`sanitize`/`JsonEnvelope` were falsely
  flagged unused. `resolvePath` in `tools/create-dependency-graph` now rewrites
  a resolved `dist/…` prefix to `src/…` (source files never import from
  `dist/`, so the rewrite is inert elsewhere). Coverage headline 84.8% → 88.3%;
  the fix also surfaced two genuinely-unused exports (`allCommands`,
  `SourceName`) the misattribution had been masking. Spawn-style references to
  `bin/upt.mjs` are not imports and remain out of scope; the
  `src/cli/commands/*` files are honestly listed as not directly
  test-imported (they are covered end-to-end via `runCli` and the spawn
  goldens).

## [0.30.0] — 2026-07-02

Rollup release: the complete CLI overhaul (this header's CLI entries) plus the
entire post-v0.29.0 audit-backlog arc (3-round codebase audit, god-file splits,
type-only-cycle refactor, `cli-api` barrel, nightly long-tests CI) recorded in
the sections below.

**Dep-health snapshot (release pre-flight, 2026-07-02):** `npm audit` — 0
vulnerabilities. `npm outdated` — no hard deps (the package has none);
optional `@danielsimonjr/mathts-*` peers have newer majors (aspirational
range), and in-range wanted bumps exist for `@types/node` (26.1.0), `js-yaml`
(5.2.1), and four mathts peers — deliberately not taken mid-release (the full
release gate ran against the current lockfile); queued as a post-release
refresh.

### Added

- **`--json` on all 14 data-bearing CLI commands.** Every command that isn't
  `help`/`version` now accepts a global `--json` flag: instead of the text
  report it prints one envelope (`{command, source?, options?, epistemics?,
  result}`) to stdout and exits `0`. A sanitizer deep-copies `result` first so
  physics' genuine non-finite values (e.g. `anchoring: Infinity` in the
  priority board) survive `JSON.stringify` as the explicit strings
  `"Infinity"`/`"-Infinity"`/`"NaN"` instead of silently collapsing to `null`;
  functions are dropped and `Map`s become plain objects. Errors NEVER emit a
  JSON envelope — a failing invocation always prints plain text to stderr,
  empty stdout, nonzero exit, `--json` or not — so **zero-exit stdout is
  always parseable**. `map --json` combined with `--format=mermaid|dot|svg`
  is rejected (`upt: pick one output form: --json or --format`, exit 2)
  rather than silently picking one.
- **`upt version` / `--version` / `-v`**, printing a bare semver line, and
  **`upt help <command>`**, printing that one command's own usage block
  (e.g. `upt help map` documents `--equation`).
- **`--source=catalog|canonical|both` extended to `explain`, `priority`,
  `audit`, `predict`, `connectors`** — all 8 graph-analysis commands now
  accept it (previously only `map`/`candidates`/`discover`). Honest
  degenerates over erroring: `priority --source=canonical` prints
  `0 non-established bridges in this graph … triage is vacuous here.` and
  exits `0` rather than an empty table or a crash. Deliberately NOT added to
  `coverage`/`canonical`/`recover`/`symbolic`/`eval`/`derive` — an unknown
  flag on those now exits 2 (see Changed).
- **Golden corpus (31 byte-exact text-output cases) + a hardening matrix**
  (unknown-flag rejection across all 14 commands, the motivating
  `--sourc=canonical` typo, `--version`/`-v`/`version` shape, per-command
  `help`, `derive` rejecting a foreign `--source`, the no-args demo rejecting
  `--json`) spawn the real `bin/upt.mjs` shim end-to-end, pinning the CLI's
  observable contract rather than just `src/cli/*` internals.

### Changed

- **Unknown or mistyped CLI flags now exit 2 with a diagnostic** — THE
  behavior change in this release. Previously an unrecognized flag (e.g.
  `upt discover --sourc=canonical`, a misspelling of `--source`) was silently
  ignored; it now exits `2` naming the bad flag and the command
  (`upt: unknown flag '--sourc' for 'discover' (see upt help discover)`).
  Flag sets are per-command and typed, so a flag valid on one command but not
  another (`upt derive --source=catalog`) is rejected the same way.
- **`bin/upt.mjs` is now a ~22-line shim over a new typed `src/cli/` TypeScript
  module**, replacing the previous single-file implementation. The shim only
  resolves `dist/cli/main.js`, guards the not-built case, and maps the
  returned exit code onto `process.exitCode` (never `process.exit`, so piped
  stdout isn't truncated); all 22 of the old CLI's `process.exit` call sites
  became returned/thrown exit codes (`UsageError` → 2, `CliError` → 1) inside
  `src/cli/`. Text output is byte-compatible with v0.29.0 for every preserved
  path (the 31-case golden corpus, plus `help`'s text, which gained 4
  appended lines documenting `upt version` and the global `--json` flag).

### Fixed

- **`upt derive … --formula` crashed with a `ReferenceError`** (`api.format`
  was undefined at the old `bin/upt.mjs:363-364` — `format` was a local
  import, not a property of `api`). Fixed and regression-pinned by
  `tests/cli/upt-derive.test.ts`, which also pins the `cli/README.md` worked
  example that had been silently broken.

Suite at the CLI-overhaul release gate: **3177 passing, 4 skipped, 1 todo**
(309 test files passed, 1 skipped) — `npm run build` clean, `npm test`
green, `npm run smoke` green.

### Added

- **Unified bridge descriptor + cross-registry drift guard
  (`bridges/descriptor.ts`).** The catalog kept three hand-maintained id-keyed
  registries — metadata (`BRIDGE_EQUATIONS`), RHS ASTs (`BRIDGE_RHS_BY_ID`), and
  graph edges (`CATALOG_GRAPH`) — that drifted silently (the stale
  `DATA_CONFRONTED` set and the `6.075e-12` value were drift symptoms).
  `BRIDGE_DESCRIPTORS` / `getBridge(id)` join them into one per-bridge view
  (`{ entry, rhs, edges }`), and `tests/bridges/descriptor-consistency.test.ts`
  fails loudly on any cross-registry mismatch (an id in one registry missing or
  inconsistent in another). A derived facade — each field still lives in its
  home registry — so the join is the single source of truth without a risky
  hand-merge of the catalog core.

### Added

- **`catalog-full.ts` god-file split by physics domain.** The 1209-line
  `composition/edges/catalog-full.ts` (26 `BridgeEdge` defs + shared
  helpers/symbolic forms) is split into four domain files —
  `catalog-quantum.ts` (7), `catalog-gravitation-cosmology.ts` (7),
  `catalog-fields.ts` (6), `catalog-condensed-matter.ts` (6) — plus
  `_catalog-helpers.ts` (the `symN`/dim/`BE*_SYMBOLIC` builders). `catalog-full.ts`
  is now a barrel re-exporting all 26 edges and the `CATALOG_FULL_EDGES` array, so
  every consumer is unchanged. Grouping follows the catalog's own `category_name`
  taxonomy collapsed to 4 domains. Behavior-preserving: build clean, 0 circular
  deps, 1642 composition+bridges tests green (incl. the catalog drift-guards).
- **`dimensional/ast-types.ts` — the AST type system in one leaf module, breaking
  the last two type-only cycles.** `ExprNode`, `TranscendentalFn`, and all ~17
  node interfaces + 5 shared index types (`Variance`, `TensorIndex`,
  `CovariantIndex`, `UpperIndex`, `Role`) previously lived spread across
  `validator.ts` and 8 sibling modules; `tensor.ts` and `curvature.ts` imported
  `ExprNode` back from `validator.ts`, forming `validator↔tensor` and
  `validator↔curvature` type-only cycles, and the derivative nodes used
  `of: unknown` casts to dodge importing `ExprNode`. All these types now live in
  `ast-types.ts` (imports only `types.ts` + the leaf `curvature-composite.ts`, so
  it has no back-edges); the 9 origin modules re-export their types from it and
  keep only their validation FUNCTIONS. `TensorPartialDerivativeNode.of` /
  `CovariantDerivativeNode.of`/`.wrt` are now properly typed `ExprNode` instead of
  `unknown`. Runtime circular deps stay 0 and **type-only circular deps drop 2 →
  0**; the ~100 downstream importers are unchanged (re-export shims); build
  (declaration emit) clean; full suite (3028) green.
- **`cli-api.ts` — single stable entrypoint for `bin/upt.mjs`.** The CLI reached
  into ~10 deep `dist/` internal module paths (several `@internal`, off the
  public surface) to assemble its imports, coupling it to the internal file
  layout — any module move silently broke the CLI. A new internal `cli-api`
  barrel re-exports everything the CLI needs from one place; `bin/upt.mjs` now
  imports a single `dist/cli-api.js`. Decoupled: layout changes touch only the
  barrel. Not re-exported from the root index, so it stays off the consumer
  public surface (30 CLI + 9 API-surface tests green).
- **`dimensional/ast-builders.ts` — single source of truth for the `sym`/`dim`
  AST builders.** The symbol-leaf builder `sym(name, dim)` and the
  `Dimension`-from-exponents builder `dim(L, M, T, I, Θ)` were copy-pasted across
  `_be-helpers`, `_l1-build`, `bridge-analysis`, `dimensional-classics`,
  `edges/calibration`, `proposed-bridges`, and `formula-dimension`. They now live
  in one zero-runtime-dep module (it imports only TYPES, so it adds no dependency
  edges and is safe to import from any layer). `_be-helpers` and `_l1-build`
  re-export `sym`/`dim` so their ~55 + 8 importers are untouched; the five
  local-copy sites import the shared builders directly. Runtime circular deps
  stay 0; full suite (2989) green.

### Tests

- **Nightly CI job runs the long GL4 / Shapiro accuracy tests (Round-2
  coverage).** Those tests are `it.skip` unless `GL4_LONG=1` (minutes-long
  symplectic-orbit + Shapiro step sweeps) — too slow per-PR but previously run
  *nowhere*, which is exactly why the GL4 step-halving bug was invisible. A new
  `long-tests` CI job runs the full suite with `GL4_LONG=1` on a nightly schedule
  (and `workflow_dispatch`), leaving PRs fast. Verified the 8 long tests pass
  with the flag (~166 s).
- **`lowerTensorPartialDerivative` direct coverage (Round-2 coverage).** Added a
  unit test for the tensor-partial arm's metric strategies (`zero` and constant
  `computed` → zero tensor; `supplied`-missing-slice throw) and the
  unsupported-operand guard. The covariant-derivative arm was already exercised
  through the dispatcher (`covariant-derivative-lowering.test.ts`). This batch of
  backfills cuts the "source files without direct test coverage" list from 14 to
  9 (the remainder are type-only ambient shims and data/registry modules covered
  indirectly); architecture coverage docs regenerated.
- **`lowering-utils` + `scanForMetricPair` coverage (Round-2 coverage).** Added
  direct unit tests for the four shared lowering helpers (`isMetricTensorNode`,
  `dimensionOf` default, `requireValue` throw, `flattenNestedArray` size guard)
  and for `metric-inverse`'s `scanForMetricPair` including both null arms
  (only-lower metric; no metric at all) — previously exercised only indirectly
  through the lowering dispatcher.
- **`dimensionalFields` biconditional coverage (Round-2 coverage).** Added tests
  pinning the `monomial !== null ⟺ freeDimensionlessGroups === 0` invariant
  across the determined, underdetermined (Newton mass-ratio), not-in-span, and
  empty-governing cases — including the edge where the π-engine alone would
  report 0 free groups for a null monomial (the `Math.max(1, gPi)` guard).
- **`reconstructNullPr` coverage + stale-doc fix (Round-2 coverage).** Added
  tests for the null-IC reconstruction: the inward (negative) root, the null
  condition `g^μν p_μ p_ν = 0` holding at the returned `p_r`, the g^rr scaling,
  and the `RangeError` error path (impact parameter too large). Corrected the
  `gInverse` param JSDoc, which still described the pre-v0.9.0 nested
  `gInverse[μ][ν]` access instead of the flat `Float64Array` `gInverse[μ*4+ν]`.
- **`normalForm` property tests (Round-2 coverage).** Added an idempotence /
  invariance / sensitivity block over a set of distinct relations: deterministic
  + reflexive (`structurallyEqual(x, x)`), constant-insensitive across several
  droppable dimensionless constants, stub-sensitive (a non-constant dimensionless
  symbol changes the hash), and nesting/ordering-invariant — generalizing the
  prior anecdotal cases.

### Changed

- **`quantities.ts` god-file split by physics domain (god-file split, part 3 —
  completes the program).** The 1117-line `composition/quantities.ts` (131
  individually-exported `Quantity` nodes) is split into
  `quantities/{quantum,gravitation-cosmology,fields,condensed-matter,common}.ts`
  (25/28/24/26/28 nodes) plus `quantities/_dims.ts` (the 16 shared dimension
  aliases). Each node is filed by its consuming `catalog-*` edge file; the two
  genuinely cross-catalog nodes (`cosmological-constant-curvature`,
  `ricci-scalar`) and the 26 consumed only by `calibration.ts` / `catalog-tranche.ts`
  go to `common.ts`. `quantities.ts` is now a barrel (`export *` of all five), so
  every importer — and the `import * as quantities` name-uniqueness test — is
  unchanged. The cross-cutting unit-convention banner (GeV-vs-J and bits-vs-nats
  heterogeneity, the G-9 guard) stays in the barrel docstring. Behavior-preserving:
  the exported name set is byte-identical to the original (131 names, diff-verified);
  build (declaration emit) + strict test-typecheck clean, 333 composition tests +
  smoke green.
- **L1 canonical batch files folded into the domain-named entry modules
  (god-file split, part 2).** The two inconsistently-named batch files —
  `canonical/entries/l1-gravity-thermo.ts` and `l1-quantum-em.ts` — are removed;
  their 12 entries moved to the existing domain modules by honest domain fit:
  `relativity.ts` ← Bekenstein–Hawking + Newton-gravitation; `thermo-nuclear-cosmo.ts`
  ← Landauer + Jarzynski + Stefan–Boltzmann + ideal-gas + Wien; `electromagnetism.ts`
  ← Coulomb + Lorentz; `atomic.ts` ← Planck–Einstein + de-Broglie + Bohr-radius.
  `registry.ts` drops the `L1_GRAVITY_THERMO`/`L1_QUANTUM_EM` imports and spreads.
  Behavior-preserving — `CANONICAL_EQUATIONS` is byte-identical (same ids, same
  content); build (declaration emit) + strict test-typecheck clean, 0 circular
  deps, 72 canonical + 41 composition tests green. The two batch tests' unique
  `validate(scalarAst) === target` check became a single registry-wide invariant
  (compared via the codebase `equals` predicate so a `-0` exponent — e.g.
  CE-half-life's `λ^-1` — no longer trips `toEqual`'s Object.is semantics); each
  destination test gained an id-membership guard.
- **`relativeSpread` is robust to sign cancellation (Round-1 Batch-3).**
  `retrodictNode` normalized the prediction span `(max − min)` by `|mean|`, so
  opposite-sign derivations (e.g. +6 and −6) cancelled in the mean → a ~0
  denominator → spurious `Infinity`. It now divides by the largest magnitude
  `max|v|`, giving the finite, meaningful spread (12/6 = 2); the verdict is
  unchanged. RED→GREEN. Also inlined the no-op identity wrapper
  `resolveChildForCovariantDerivative` in `validator.ts` (it only delegated to
  the partial-derivative resolver). `numericalRecovery`'s `bv === 0` guard
  (linkage.ts) is left as-is — its all-or-nothing skip is intentionally
  conservative (a zero sample makes the cv/bv ratio undefined).
- **`js-yaml` dev dependency bumped 4 → 5 (major; dev-only, no security impact).**
  Updated the root devDependency and the `create-dependency-graph` tool (its only
  consumer) to `^5.0.0`. js-yaml v5 is ESM with named exports only, so the tool's
  `import yaml from 'js-yaml'` became `import { dump } from 'js-yaml'`, and the v4
  quoting options `quotingType: '"'` + `forceQuotes: false` became
  `quoteStyle: 'auto'` (quote only when necessary, preferring double — `'double'`
  would force-quote scalars and tag integers `!!int`). v5 bundles its own types,
  so the redundant `@types/js-yaml` dev dep was dropped. Verified: `npm run
  docs:deps` regenerates valid, cleanly-formatted YAML; `npm run build` clean;
  0 vulnerabilities.
  The perihelion finder's cubic-Hermite root solver evaluated the linear
  estimate `sInitial` but then discarded it, bisecting from the midpoint. It now
  uses that (otherwise-wasted) evaluation's sign to tighten the guaranteed
  bracket before bisecting — preserving the sign-bracket invariant (so the
  converged root is identical) while giving a good linear estimate a smaller
  starting interval. Behavior-identical (perihelion + Mercury-confrontation
  tests green; precession still within 1σ).
- **`setActiveEngine` wins over an in-flight detection (Round-2 robustness).**
  Its docstring promised to "invalidate any prior in-flight detection," but a
  caller already awaiting an in-flight `getActiveEngine()` detection still
  received the auto-detected engine, not the just-set override. A synchronous
  `_override` is now recorded by `setActiveEngine` and re-checked by the
  detection IIFE after its async import resolves, so a mid-detection override
  wins for the in-flight awaiter too. `resetEngineForTesting` clears it.
  RED→GREEN via an in-flight-override test.
- **`christoffel` asserts its geometrized (dimensionless) metric (Round-2
  robustness).** The connection builder is documented for the geometrized
  convention (Γ ~ 1/LENGTH from a dimensionless metric), and the numerical
  lowering relies on it, but it never checked — a dimensionful metric would
  silently yield a wrong-dimensioned connection. It now throws `TypeError`
  unless both `gLower.dim` and `gInverse.dim` are dimensionless. All existing
  (geometrized) callers are unaffected; RED→GREEN via a `MASS`-metric test.
- **`upt discover` rejects malformed `--max-orders` / `--anchor` (Round-2
  robustness).** Both silently ignored bad values — and `--max-orders=` coerced
  via `Number('')` to `0` (making every candidate a magnitude-clash) without a
  word to the user. They now exit 2 with a diagnostic on a non-numeric, empty,
  or negative `--max-orders`, and on an `--anchor` entry missing `=value` or with
  a non-finite value — matching `parseKnown`'s reject-don't-drop contract.
  RED→GREEN via a new `tests/cli/upt-discover-opts.test.ts`.
- **`forwardEvaluate` rejects a non-finite ground-truth seed (Round-2
  robustness).** Computed edge values were finiteness-guarded, but the seed map
  was copied in unchecked, so a `NaN`/`∞` ground-truth value propagated silently
  through the graph and could spoof downstream magnitude / consistency checks
  (e.g. discovery's anchor-derived magnitudes). It now throws `TypeError` on a
  non-finite seed, matching the library-wide finiteness discipline. RED→GREEN.
- **`inferUnknownDimension` tolerates FP round-off in the target (Round-2
  robustness).** The integrality gate used a bare `Number.isInteger` on a
  computed exponent, so a real integer answer that arrived with round-off in the
  target dimension (`L = 2 + ε`, as a v0.20 fractional-power computation can
  leave) was spuriously rejected. It now snaps each exponent to its nearest
  integer within `EXPONENT_TOL` and abstains only on genuinely-fractional
  results — the same tolerance philosophy as `equals` (bb15432). `EXPONENT_TOL`
  is now exported from `dimensional/algebra` as the single source for that
  tolerance (not re-exported through the public index). RED→GREEN via a
  noisy-target test; a genuinely-`½` exponent still abstains.
- **Deduplicated the AD dispatch in `float64-engine.ts` (Round-1 cleanup).**
  `add`/`sub`/`mul` each repeated the same three-way branch (forward-mode dual
  path, reverse-mode tape path, primal Float64 fallback). Extracted one
  `adBinary(a, b, method, prim)` helper — the dual/tape classes share a single
  `add`/`sub`/`mul` signature, so the `a[method](b)` call is type-safe. Six
  `instanceof` branches collapse to one helper plus three one-line methods.
  Behavior-identical (470 diff/numerical tests incl. AD-conformance + autograd
  green).
- **`gradientToNamed` rejects a length-mismatched gradient (Round-1
  robustness).** The `@public` helper indexed an arbitrary caller-supplied
  gradient tensor against `spec.paramNames`, so a too-short gradient silently
  produced `undefined` fields (and a too-long one dropped entries). It now
  throws `RangeError` when `gradient.length !== paramNames.length`. Also
  tightened `bridge-ast-gradient`'s bound-variable lookup from `if (bound)` to
  `if (bound !== undefined)` (a TapedScalar is always truthy, so this is an
  intent/clarity fix, not a behavior change). The internal
  `as unknown as Input` cast was left as-is — it targets a generic type
  parameter with no runtime schema, and the one checkable invariant (unpacked
  length) is guaranteed by construction in `bridgeGradient`.
- **Un-exported genuinely-internal types; deleted a dead alias (Round-1
  type-hygiene).** `evalFormulaAst` (an unused re-export of the internal
  `evalNode`) is removed, and eight module-internal symbols with no external or
  test reference drop their `export`: `NamedConstantValue`, `GaussLegendreNode`,
  `L1Rest`, `EFE_NODE`, and the four `proposed-bridges` types `EquationSource` /
  `PromotionEvidence` / `PromotionRequest` / `ProposedBridgeEntry` (`ProposedBridge`
  stays exported — it has external consumers). Each is still used within its own
  module, so the emitted `.d.ts` keeps it as a local declaration; `npm run build`
  (declaration emit) and the public-surface snapshot are unchanged, confirming
  none were public. Shrinks the accidental API surface.
- **`bridge-analysis` hoists the constant power-set and adds `mapGetOrInsert`
  (Round-1 perf + cleanup).** `subsetsBySize(FUNDAMENTAL_CONSTANTS)` (the 32
  size-ordered subsets) was rebuilt and re-sorted on every `dimensionalFreedom`
  / `attemptDerivation` call; it is now a module const computed once
  (`FUNDAMENTAL_CONSTANT_SUBSETS`). A `mapGetOrInsert` helper replaces the
  `if (!m.has(k)) m.set(k, …); m.get(k)!` two-step (and its `!` assertion) at the
  five get-or-insert sites (`anchoringDistance`'s adjacency, `clusterMap`'s
  `qToEdges`/`groups`, `proposeOrphanConnectors`'s `qToEdges`). The other
  Batch-1 sub-items were already addressed: `anchoringDistance` is single-pass,
  and the redundant `enumerateCompositions` calls were removed by the earlier
  `clusterMap`/`linkageMap` split. Behavior-identical (62 tests green).
- **Curvature zero-tensor allocations factored into helpers (Round-1 cleanup).**
  Six copies of the nested `Array.from({length:N}, …)` zero-tensor builder in
  `curvature-lowering-helpers.ts` (three 4-deep, three 5-deep) are replaced by
  `nestedZeros4`/`nestedZeros5` (the latter reusing the former). Typed local
  helpers (not the generic `NestedArray`-returning `buildNestedZeros`) keep the
  concrete `number[][][][]`/`[…][]` types without casts. Identical allocations;
  24 curvature tests green.
- **Geodesic integrator reuses a Christoffel scratch buffer (Round-1 perf).**
  `christoffelFnFlat`'s closure allocated a fresh `Float64Array(64)` on every
  call — ~4·steps per integration (~160k for a long run). The closure now
  accepts an optional `out` buffer (filled and returned in place; omitting it
  preserves the original fresh-allocation behavior, so external callers are
  unaffected), and `integrateGeodesic` threads a single reused scratch through
  all four RK4 Christoffel evaluations per step. Safe because each `geodesicRHS`
  fully consumes Γ into the acceleration before the next call. Numerically
  identical (9 christoffel/geodesic tests green, incl. two new buffer-reuse
  tests). The deeper per-`geodesicRHS` `dx`/`dv` scratch was left as-is — a
  more invasive RK4 rewrite for a smaller gain.
- **`equals` unrolled over the 7 base dimensions (Round-2 perf).** The
  hot-path dimension-equality check looped over a `BASES` array with
  dynamic-key access (`a[base]`); it now compares the seven fields directly and
  short-circuits. Speeds up every `add`/`subtract` and `format`'s
  named-dimension scan. Tolerance (`EXPONENT_TOL`, the v0.20 fractional-power
  round-off fix) is preserved exactly — `equals` stays intentionally distinct
  from `linkage.ts`'s exact `dimEqual` (they are different predicates, so the
  audit's "unify them" suggestion does not apply). The `format` named-dimension
  lookup-table was evaluated and declined: `format` is only called on error
  paths and one-time registry builds (never a hot loop), so a packed-signature
  LUT would add complexity for no measurable gain — and unrolling `equals`
  already speeds its scan. 499 dimensional tests green.
- **Bianchi path reuses the center Christoffel instead of recomputing it
  (Round-2 perf).** `covariantDerivRiemannLowerAt` computed `gamma =
  christoffelAt(x)` and then `riemannLowerAt(x)`, which recomputed
  `christoffelAt(x)` internally. `riemannUpperAt`/`riemannLowerAt` now take an
  optional precomputed Γ (defaulted, so every other caller is unchanged), and
  the Bianchi path forwards the Γ it already holds. Numerically identical
  (`christoffelAt` is a pure function of x; Schwarzschild/de Sitter residuals
  stay ≤1e-6 to the last bit; 17 curvature tests green). Scoped deliberately to
  this single same-coordinate redundancy: the FD layers (`dGammaAt`,
  `dRiemannLowerAt`) sample Christoffel at *perturbed* coordinates that never
  coincide, so a full coordinate-keyed cache would add churn and risk to the
  precision-tuned pipeline for no further benefit (declined).
- **Linkage proposers skip the O(E²) composition count (Round-2 perf).**
  `linkageMap` always computed `enumerateCompositions(edges).all.length`, but
  `proposeLinkCandidates` and `proposeOrphanConnectors` only read the cluster
  fields — so the quadratic count fired needlessly on every `upt
  discover`/`candidates`/`connectors` (and twice for connectors, which calls
  both proposers). Split the cheap cluster core into an internal `clusterMap`;
  `linkageMap` now wraps it and adds the count, and only it (the `upt map`
  headline) pays the quadratic cost. `linkageMap`'s output and signature are
  unchanged. Behavior identical (linkage-map/link-candidates/orphan-connectors/
  discovery/graph-viz — 60 tests green).
- **`scanLinkages` precomputes per-operand instead of per-pair (Round-2 perf).**
  `classifyLinkage` recomputed `validate(bridgeRhs)` and `normalForm(bridgeRhs)`
  (both bridge-only) and `normalForm(canon.scalarAst)` (canonical-only) for every
  one of the ~C×B canonical×bridge pairs. `scanLinkages` now validates +
  normal-forms each bridge once into a `BridgePrecomp`, computes each canonical's
  normal-form once per outer iteration, and the inner loop only compares
  precomputed strings/dimensions — reducing ~3·C·B AST walks to ~2·B + C (the
  `upt recover` hot path). `classifyLinkage` keeps its signature (delegates
  through the shared core); a new equivalence-guard test pins `scanLinkages`
  against the brute-force per-pair enumeration. Behavior identical.
- **Discovery hoists candidate-invariant work out of the per-candidate loop
  (Round-2 perf — biggest pipeline win).** `rankDiscoveries` vetted all 132
  candidates by calling `vetLinkCandidate` once each, and every call recomputed
  `forwardEvaluate` (anchor magnitudes), `quantityComponents` (base partition),
  and the *base* `forwardClosure` — none of which depend on the candidate. These
  are now computed once into a shared `DiscoveryContext`; only the
  hypothesis-augmented closure and retrodiction stay per-candidate. `upt
  discover` does the three invariant graph walks once instead of 132×. Behavior
  identical — `vetLinkCandidate` keeps its signature (delegates through the
  context), and a new equivalence-guard test pins the shared-context path
  byte-for-byte against independent per-candidate vetting (catches any mutable
  state leaking across the now-shared structures).
- **`buckinghamPi` runs one RREF instead of two (Round-2 perf).** The rank was
  computed by a dedicated `rref` on a matrix copy, then `nullSpace` ran `rref`
  again; the rank is just the pivot count from the null-space reduction.
  `nullSpace` now returns `{ basis, rank }`, halving the linear-algebra cost of
  every `buckinghamPi` call (the whole dimensional layer: `audit` / `priority` /
  `derive`). Behavior identical (37 dimensional/derivation tests green).
- **Round-3 audit cleanup (docs + trivial dedup).** Corrected stale header
  docstrings in BE-25/26/40 that still described the pre-v0.19/v0.21
  symbol-stub encoding although the code now uses faithful `transcendental`
  AST nodes (`log2`/`exp`/`sin`/`cos`); de-duplicated BE-20's Λ literal behind
  a single `PLANCK_2018_LAMBDA` const; added a `@public` tag to `UniversalTensor`
  and brief JSDoc to `validate`/`validateEquation` and the `dimensional/algebra`
  operators. No behavior change.
- **CI now fails loud when the optional MathTS autograd peer is missing.** The
  AST-AD test arc gates on peer presence via `it.runIf(...)`, so a failed
  optional-peer install previously skipped the entire headline feature behind a
  green check. A new `tests/peers-required.test.ts` guard fails when
  `UPT_REQUIRE_PEERS` is set (CI now sets `UPT_REQUIRE_PEERS=1`) but the peer is
  absent. Shared detection lives in `tests/helpers/peers.ts`.

### Fixed

- **CI never built `dist/`, so the whole suite was red on `master`.** The four
  `tests/cli/*` files shell out to `bin/upt.mjs`, which dynamically imports
  `dist/cli-api.js`; the CI `test` job ran only `tsc --noEmit` (emits nothing)
  before `vitest run`, so the CLI hit its "Could not load the built package"
  catch and exited 1 on every call — failing all six `upt-explain-inputs`
  assertions (and the other CLI suites) as spurious exit-code mismatches. Added
  an emitting `npm run build` step to both CI jobs, and a `pretest: tsc` hook so
  a clean local `npm test` self-builds too. Full suite: 3007 passed / 4 skipped.
- **Finiteness guards unified across the numerical layer (Round-2 MED).**
  `evalExpr`/`validateFiniteInputs` already threw on non-finite values, but three
  paths returned NaN/∞ silently: `integrateGaussLegendre` (now throws on
  non-finite bounds or result), the `upt eval` formula evaluator (now throws on a
  non-finite result, e.g. `1/0`), and `bridgeGradientNumerical` (the param guard
  checked `typeof` — which `NaN` passes — now checks `Number.isFinite`, and a
  non-positive/non-finite `relStep`, which collapses the FD denominator to 0, is
  rejected). Pinned by `tests/numerical/finiteness-guards.test.ts` and new cases
  in `tests/diff/bridge-gradient.test.ts`.
- **BE-37 `eikonalResidual` was a hardcoded 0 on a false null-condition (Round-2 MED).**
  The `@public` field claimed `g^μν k_μ k_ν = 0` "by construction" for `k_μ =
  (E,E,0,0)` — which is **not** null in Schwarzschild — and returned a literal
  `0` without computing anything. It now computes the actual relative residual
  `|g^μν p_μ p_ν| / Σ|term|` on the real wave-covector (whose `p_r` is solved by
  `reconstructNullPr` to be genuinely null), yielding ~machine-ε. The existing
  `< 1e-9`/`< 1e-10` test assertions, previously trivially true, now meaningfully
  verify the null construction. Shapiro path unchanged.
- **`equals()` exact-float compare broke on fractional exponents (Round-2 MED).**
  Dimension equality used `!==` per base, so a `M^0.5` exponent reached by
  different op chains (v0.20 dimensionful fractional powers) could read as
  unequal on a ULP mismatch (`0.30000000000000004` vs `0.3`). `equals` now
  compares within `EXPONENT_TOL = 1e-9` — physical exponents are integers or
  simple rationals (steps ≥ ~1/3), far above the tolerance, so genuine
  distinctions are preserved. Pinned in `tests/dimensional/algebra.test.ts`;
  full dimensional/bridge/canonical suites (627 tests) stay green.
- **Discovery magnitude-clash falsifier had asymmetric validation (Round-2 MED).**
  `vetLinkCandidate`'s magnitude gate applied an `isFinite && != 0` check on the
  anchor-derived value but not on the static representative-value table, so a
  `0`/`∞`/`NaN` table entry made `log10` blow up — spoofing a spurious clash
  (log10(0) = -∞) or silently disabling the falsifier. Both value sources now
  share the gate. Pinned by two cases in `tests/composition/discovery.test.ts`.
- **Docstring value errors in BE-20 / BE-21 (Round-2 doc).** BE-21's KSS bound
  comment said `≈6.075e-12 K·s` (10× high) and BE-20's vacuum-energy comment said
  `≈7×10⁻¹⁰ J/m³`; corrected to `6.078e-13 K·s` and `5.30×10⁻¹⁰ J/m³`. The
  evaluators (and the BE-21 test assertion) were already correct — comments only.
  Both values independently confirmed by Adam (gemini-2.5-pro) and Eve (o3).
- **`dim()` helper param order aligned with the canonical `Dimension`
  (Round-1 Batch-1).** `bridge-analysis.ts`'s local `dim()` took
  `(L, M, T, Theta, I)` while the `Dimension` interface orders fields
  `(L, M, T, I, Theta)` — a footgun for anyone copying a positional call. The
  helper now matches `(L, M, T, I, Theta)` with the two affected callsites
  (`k_B`, `e`) updated; the resulting dimensions are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Stale `DATA_CONFRONTED` set in the priority scorecard (Round-1 Batch-1).**
  `bridge-analysis.ts` carried a private `{23, 36}` copy (missing BE-52) of the
  data-confronted bridge ids, so the priority scorecard's data-confrontation
  flag disagreed with the coverage audit. It now imports the single
  `DATA_CONFRONTED_IDS` source of truth (`{23, 36, 52}`) from
  `confrontation-coverage.ts`; the local duplicate is deleted.
- **`op('/')` empty/1-arg convention aligned across layers (Round-1 Batch-2/3).**
  `lowering.ts` threw on a zero-operand `/` while the validator
  (`'*'/'/'` with 0 args → DIMENSIONLESS) and `expr-eval` (empty → 1) treated it
  as the multiplicative identity. Lowering now matches: empty `/` → 1, ≥1-arg
  left-folds (1-arg → the operand) consistently across validator, expr-eval, and
  lowering. `^` still requires exactly 2 operands everywhere. Pinned by
  `tests/numerical/lowering-contract.test.ts`.
- **`collectSymbols` dropped leaves inside transcendental/abs/dirac-delta arms
  (correctness, Round-1 Batch-3).** `freeLeaves` (via `makeObservable`) computes
  an `Observable`'s declared inputs; its walker handled only
  symbol/op/integral/derivative, so a symbolic form whose leaves sit inside a
  `transcendental` (BE-37 ln, BE-26 exp), `abs` (BE-41), `dirac-delta`, or
  `variational-derivative` node silently lost those inputs — the Observable
  would then reject a valid call or accept a wrong one. The walker now descends
  every scalar arm carrying an inner expression. Pinned by
  `tests/composition/collect-symbols-transcendental.test.ts`.
- **CLI `upt explain` silently dropped/coerced malformed inputs (correctness, HIGH).**
  `parseKnown` demoted `mass=abc` (NaN) to a bare name, coerced `mass=` to `0`,
  let `mass=1e500` flow in as `Infinity`, and dropped a bare name whenever any
  `name=value` was present — each silently produced wrong physics. The parser
  now rejects malformed `name=value` tokens, non-finite values, and name/value
  mixing with exit code 2 and a diagnostic. Pinned by
  `tests/cli/upt-explain-inputs.test.ts`.
- **GL4 step-halving advanced by the wrong step (correctness, HIGH).**
  `integrateGeodesicGL4`'s adaptive step-halving solved the implicit stages at
  a reduced step `h/2ᵏ` on Picard non-convergence but then advanced the state
  **and** τ by the full `h`, destroying accuracy and symplecticity on every
  recovery step (the geodesic Hamiltonian norm drifted O(1)). The recovery path
  now sub-steps: a macro-step that needs halving is covered by micro-steps of
  the converging size, with the state update using that size, so the norm stays
  conserved to GL4 accuracy. The fixed `(n+1)·h` snapshot grid is unchanged.
  Regression-pinned by `tests/numerical/gl4-step-halving.test.ts` (a synthetic
  curved metric that deterministically forces halving — the prior long-run
  orbit test was skip-by-default, which is why the bug was invisible).

## [0.29.0] — 2026-06-21

The "three frontiers" release. One code contribution — the catalog's first
**established-bridge real-data confrontation** (BE-52 × Mercury's perihelion) — plus
four research/adjudication notes that close out the discovery-pipeline's candidate
sets and calibrate its precision. Net epistemic result of the session: **8
machine-surfaced candidates, independently adjudicated, 0 false positives promoted**;
data-confronted bridges 2 → 3.

**Dependency health (release pre-flight):** `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**;
`npm outdated` → only `js-yaml` 4.2.0 (dev-only; 5.0.0 major, deferred). Suite **2949
passed** / 4 skipped / 1 todo (2954) across 290 test files; `tsc` + `tsc -p
tsconfig.tests.json` clean; 187 files / 1335 exports; 0 runtime circular deps.

### Added — BE-52 × Mercury real-data confrontation (empirical-grounding frontier)

- `confrontBE52` / `MERCURY` (`src/bridges/be52-mercury-confrontation.ts`): the
  catalog's **third** committed real-data confrontation and the **first for an
  established bridge**. Recomputes BE-52's GR perihelion advance from Mercury's
  orbital elements (~42.98″/century) and confronts the classic measured anomalous
  precession (43.11 ± 0.45 ″/cy, Clemence 1947) — agrees within 1σ. Data-confronted
  bridges 2 → **3** (empirical gap 42 → 41). Public exports + coverage tooling +
  tests updated. Addresses the empirical-grounding frontier: the established GR
  spine had famous tests that weren't encoded.

### Documentation — discovery-funnel precision calibration (no gate change)

- Investigated the "funnel precision" frontier: the magnitude gate is
  threshold-insensitive (`--max-orders` 1→12 moves promising only 48→58), and this
  session's adjudications yielded **8 auto-surfaced candidates → 0 genuine**. The
  precision ceiling is *structural* (dimensional/same-kind matching can't see
  mechanism); tightening would falsify the cross-domain candidates UPT exists to
  surface. Conclusion: precision is delivered by the firewall + human adjudication
  (empirically, 0 false positives promoted), not by gating — **no gate change made**.
  New doc `docs/research/discovery-precision-calibration.md`.

### Documentation — orphan-connector adjudication (isolated frontier; 0 of 3 genuine)

- Adjudicated the most-motivated "same-kind" orphan connectors (`upt connectors`)
  with independent Adam + Eve review: **all 3 decoys** (coarsening-length ≠
  quantum-correlation-length, tunneling-mass ≠ quasiparticle effective-mass,
  mutation-rate ≠ decoherence-rate). Refines the earlier "CI-1 genuinely motivated"
  claim → decoy on review. The ~17 isolated bridges are isolated by *physics*, not
  vocabulary — honest catalog sparsity, not a tooling gap. New doc
  `docs/research/orphan-connector-adjudication.md`; `Linkage-Candidate-Proposals.md`
  updated. No `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS` change.

### Documentation — proposed-equations adjudication (0 of 5 promoted)

- Ran the 5 machine-derived proposed equations (Part-XI) through the Status-Promotion
  Protocol with independent Adam (gemini-2.5-pro) + Eve (o3) review. Verdict: **0
  promoted** — PE-1/PE-2/PE-5 dimensional coincidences, PE-4 trivial/definitional,
  PE-3 (`m=hν/c²`, Compton/de-Broglie frequency) recognized but already entailed by
  the L-layer. No catalog change (firewall holds). Recorded in
  `docs/research/proposed-equations-adjudication.md`; Part-XI gains an adjudication
  banner. Also documents a firewall-safe finding: overlaying the proposals on the map
  composes them into a hubble-rate→temperature→ν→mass chain (15→13 components) — a
  chain of coincidences, the amplification rule #5 exists to prevent.

## [0.28.0] — 2026-06-21

First npm release since 0.25.0 — ships the full accumulated body of work: the
parser-consolidation program (Phase 1 `parsePhysics` + dimensional `--equation`,
GitHub v0.26.0; Phase 2 single-IR transpiler, GitHub v0.27.0), the bridges-vs-canonical
follow-up (the `thermal-de-broglie-wavelength ≡ thermal-wavelength` alias, the
`dimensionAdjacency` review surface), and the **Adam+Eve canonical-L-layer expansion
26 → 66 equations** with all the doc/map sync. npm `latest` jumps 0.25.0 → 0.28.0
(0.26.0/0.27.0 were GitHub-only releases).

**Dependency health (release pre-flight):** `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**;
`npm outdated` → only `js-yaml` 4.2.0 (dev-only; 5.0.0 is a major bump, deferred —
no security impact). Suite **2945 passed** / 4 skipped / 1 todo (2950) across 289
test files; `tsc` + `tsc -p tsconfig.tests.json` clean; 0 runtime circular deps.

### Added — canonical L-layer expansion via Adam+Eve adversarial audit (29 → 66)

Adam (gemini-2.5-pro) and Eve (o3) independently produced the complete list of
fundamental textbook MONOMIAL dimensional laws the registry was missing; added the
genuinely-fitting ones (skipping pure constant-identities like `c²=1/ε₀μ₀` and
exact dimensional duplicates like equipartition≡Landauer). Both also flagged
ideal-gas/EFE/Friedmann/Lorentz/Jarzynski as non-pure-monomial — verified these are
**intentional** (N is dimensionless; the L2 field-equation tier and documented stub
patterns), so no corrections. Added by domain:

- **Mechanics (+13)** (`entries/mechanics.ts`): kinetic-energy, rotational-KE,
  gravitational-potential-energy, work, spring-PE, power, centripetal-force,
  Hooke's law, torque, angular-momentum, moment-of-inertia, impulse, and the
  simple-harmonic angular frequency (a √-law: dimensional-only, engine-derived
  fractional monomial like the pendulum). Two-body `U=−Gm₁m₂/r` carries the same
  inherent mass-ratio free group as newton-gravitation (monomial null, free=1).
- **Electromagnetism (+11)** (`entries/electromagnetism.ts`): Ohm's law,
  electrical-power, material resistance, parallel-plate capacitance,
  capacitor/inductor energy, long-wire field, cyclotron frequency, Larmor radius,
  point-charge field, LC resonance (√-law). Maxwell's PDEs out of scope.
- **Fluids & waves (+7)** (`entries/fluids-waves.ts`, domain `mechanics`):
  hydrostatic pressure, pressure & density definitions, buoyancy, Stokes drag,
  wave relation `v=fλ`, fluid sound-speed (√-law). Navier–Stokes (PDE) out of scope.
- **Thermo / nuclear / cosmology (+3)** (`entries/thermo-nuclear-cosmo.ts`):
  sensible heat `Q=mcΔT`, radioactive half-life `t½=ln2/λ`, Hubble distance
  `D_H=c/H₀`. Skipped as degenerate: radioactive-activity `A=λN` (N dimensionless)
  and Chandrasekhar mass (underdetermined — `(ℏc/G)/m_p²` is dimensionless).
- **Atomic derived constants (+3)** (`entries/atomic.ts`, domain `quantum`):
  Rydberg energy, classical electron radius, Bohr magneton — monomial combinations
  of fundamental constants, like the existing Bohr radius / Planck units. The
  fine-structure constant α (dimensionless-only) is out of scope.
- A registry-wide invariant now guards that **every determinate canonical monomial
  reproduces its target dimension** (`invariants.test.ts`), covering all batches.

**Downstream effects of the expansion** (all intended — the funnels scale with the
registry): the bridges-vs-canonical map now connects **20 of 41** bridges (was 18 —
the new `time` and `hubble-rate` quantities connect BE-15 and BE-47); the
identity-consequence surfacer now emits **3** unadjudicated proposals (was 1 — the
Landauer photon, plus `hν=mc²` photon↔rest-energy and `c/H≟b/T`
hubble↔Wien-length, both passing the same fully-quantitative+determinate gate). The
research doc `docs/research/bridges-vs-canonical-map.md` is updated accordingly.

### Documentation — proposed-equations + map docs synced to the expansion

- `docs/specification/Part-XI-Proposed-Equations.md`: **2 → 5** proposed equations
  (`--source=both`; 1 → 3 for `--source=canonical`) — added PE-3 `m=hν/c²`
  (photon↔rest-energy), PE-4 `m=vg/c²` (dark-fermion↔rest-energy), PE-5 `T=bH/c`
  (Hubble↔Wien). The growth confirms the section's own prediction (new clean
  monomial laws, not knob-tuning).
- `docs/architecture/PHYSICS_MAP.md` + regenerated `docs/architecture/maps/both.{dot,svg}`:
  `--source=both` now **107 edges → 32 components** (was 67 → 30).

### Documentation — housekeeping the expansion (counts, maps, baseline)

- Regenerated the dependency graph (`npm run docs:deps`) and refreshed the
  architecture counts: **186 source files** (was 180), **1329 exports** (541
  re-exports), **canonical 16 files / 66 equations** (was 11 / 26), 41 graph edges +
  **66 canonical-only law edges**; coverage **92.5%** (172/186); 0 runtime circular
  deps. (`COMPONENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`.)
- Regenerated all physics-map artifacts and **added a canonical (66-law) map**:
  `maps/{catalog,both,canonical}.{dot,svg}`, referenced from `PHYSICS_MAP.md`.
- Added a current-state update banner to `docs/research/v0.23.0-canonical-only-baseline.md`:
  at 66 laws the canonical-only funnel is **120 candidates → 7 promising · 9
  magnitude-clash · 0 contradictory** (15 map components) — self-consistency holds at
  the larger scale.

### Added — foundational mechanics in the canonical L-layer (26 → 29 equations)

- Added the dimensional textbook laws the registry was missing
  (`src/canonical/entries/mechanics.ts`): **Newton's second law** `F = m a`
  (`force ⟵ mass·acceleration`), **mass–energy equivalence** `E = m c²`
  (`rest-energy ⟵ mass·c²`), and **(non-relativistic) momentum** `p = m v`
  (`p ⟵ mass·velocity`) — each a unique dimensional monomial, fully-quantitative,
  dimensionally validated. `p = m v` also anchors de Broglie's previously-free
  `p` input within the canonical graph. Canonical-only discovery stays **0
  contradictory** (the additions introduce no inconsistency).
- This is the "only laws that genuinely fit" outcome of the bridges-vs-canonical
  audit: generic, purely *dimensional* textbook laws. The dimensionless /
  domain-specific isolated-established bridges (Yang–Mills β, KSS η/s,
  Kibble–Zurek) are deliberately **not** added — they sit outside a
  dimension-centric L-layer (documented in `docs/research/bridges-vs-canonical-map.md`).
  These laws complete the registry's mechanics coverage but do not change *bridge*
  attachment (bridges name quantities specifically, e.g. `mond-force` ≠ `force`).

### Added — dimension-adjacency review surface (`dimensionAdjacency`)

- **`dimensionAdjacency(quantities, referenceDims)`** (`src/composition/
  dimension-adjacency.ts`, public): for every quantity absent from a reference
  vocabulary BY NAME but matching a reference quantity BY DIMENSION (dimensionless
  excluded), list the same-dimension candidates. Upgrades the bridges-vs-canonical
  map from name-adjacency to dimension-adjacency — it systematizes finding
  name-divergent true aliases (the way `thermal-de-broglie-wavelength ≡
  thermal-wavelength` was found by hand) and registry gaps. Strictly a **review
  surface, never an auto-merge** (same dimension ≠ same quantity); reuses the
  Phase-1 dimensional machinery.

### Changed — `thermal-de-broglie-wavelength ≡ thermal-wavelength` identification

- Added a `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS` entry folding the catalog's
  `thermal-de-broglie-wavelength` (BE-11 Zurek, BE-12) onto the canonical L-layer's
  `thermal-wavelength` (`CE-thermal-de-broglie`) — the same physical quantity under
  two names. Surfaced by the bridges-vs-canonical map: it reconnects BE-11 (an
  *established* bridge) to standard physics, a link previously hidden purely by the
  name divergence. Canonical-only linkage is unaffected (the name occurs only in
  the catalog). Mirrors the existing `de-broglie ≡ compton` precedent.

## [0.27.0] — 2026-06-20

> **GitHub release only — not yet published to npm** (npm `latest` stays at
> 0.25.0). The parser-consolidation program is now complete (Phase 1 in v0.26.0,
> Phase 2 here); the single npm publish follows.

### Release hygiene

- `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**; **zero hard runtime dependencies** (the
  `@viz-js/viz` svg peer remains optional). Counts unchanged from v0.26.0 (Phase 2
  added no public exports or source files): **180 source files · 1319 exports**;
  suite **2929 passing**.

### Changed — Phase 2: AST consolidation (one transpiler, `ExprNode` the single IR)

- **`formula-dimension.ts`'s two structurally-parallel transpilers unified.** The
  MathTS AST and the built-in `FormulaAstNode` are now each adapted (thin,
  dimension-free `mathtsToPNode` / `pathBToPNode`) to one **normalized parse node**
  (`PNode`), and a single `normToExpr` owns all the dimensional transpilation;
  one `pnodeConstant` folds constant exponents (replacing the duplicated
  `mathtsConstant` / `pathBConstant`). A new convergence test pins that both
  front-ends now produce **identical `ExprNode`** for the same expression. Pure
  refactor — public surface (`parsePhysics` / `check` / `parse` /
  `FormulaDimensionError`) and `CompiledFormula`'s evaluator are unchanged. This
  makes `ExprNode` unambiguously the single *semantic* IR; the parse-trees are
  transient frontends. (Lower-risk variant: the formula evaluator was deliberately
  not retired.)
- **One deliberate narrowing:** constant exponents now fold over literal arithmetic
  only (`+ - * / ^`, unary minus). A function or named constant in an *exponent*
  (e.g. `x^sqrt(4)`, `r^pi`) — which the old per-parser evaluators folded — is now
  rejected; real physics exponents are literal rationals, and the catalog's
  hand-built bridges are unaffected. Pinned by a negative test.

## [0.26.0] — 2026-06-20

> **GitHub release only — not yet published to npm** (npm `latest` stays at
> 0.25.0). The parser-consolidation program publishes to npm once all phases are
> implemented.

### Release hygiene

- **Dependency health:** `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**. `npm outdated`:
  `js-yaml` 4.2.0 has a 5.0.0 major available (dev-only, used by `docs:deps`);
  deferred — not a vulnerability, and a major bump mid-program adds risk. **Zero
  hard runtime dependencies**; the optional `@viz-js/viz` peer (svg) is unchanged.
- **Architecture-doc counts refreshed** (`npm run docs:deps`): **180 source files
  · 1319 exports (537 re-exports)**, coverage **166/180 = 92.2%**, suite **2920
  passing**, runtime circular deps **0** (2 type-only).

### Added — `parsePhysics` + dimensionally-aware `--equation` (parser → ExprNode)

- **`parsePhysics(text, dims) → { expr, dimension }` (public, `numerical`):** the
  single string→dimensional-`ExprNode` entry point, over the active front-end
  (MathTS when the peer is installed, else the built-in parser). Factored out of
  the formula dimension checker (which now wraps it); `FormulaDimensionError` and
  `ParsedPhysics` are public.
- **Scalar grammar gap closed:** the transpilers now emit faithful
  `transcendental` (`exp/ln/log2/log10/sin/cos/tan/sinh/cosh/tanh`; `log`→`ln`)
  and dimension-preserving `abs` nodes instead of lossy stubs — so `exp(energy)`
  is now correctly rejected and `|x|` keeps its dimension. (`asin/acos/atan/
  sec/csc/cot` remain dimensionless stubs; calculus/tensor kinds stay
  builder-only.)
- **Single-unknown dimensional inference (`src/dimensional/dimension-inference.ts`,
  public):** `inferUnknownDimension(expr, unknown, targetDim)` recovers an
  unknown symbol's dimension from homogeneity (probe method), or abstains
  (`null`) when not uniquely pinned; `substituteSymbolDim` supports it.
- **`upt map --equation` is now dimensionally aware:** `analyzeUserEquation`
  parses the RHS (physics constants carry their real dimensions), reports
  **✓ consistent / ⚠ mismatch** against the target's catalog dimension, and gives
  a **dimension-based** "did you mean?" (inferring an unknown's dimension →
  `suggestByDimension`), falling back to name-similarity. A non-homogeneous RHS
  (e.g. `period = length + gravity`) exits non-zero. The graph landing is
  unchanged; the user junction is still quarantined from the catalog.

### Added — inject a user equation into the map (`upt map --equation`)

- **`upt map --equation "TARGET = EXPR"`** places a user-supplied equation into
  the physics graph as a violet `user` junction and reports where it lands — which
  cluster it joins and the shared quantities that connect it — or that it is
  isolated. Composes with `--source` / `--proposed` and every `--format`
  (`text` prints the landing to stdout; `mermaid`/`dot`/`svg` render the violet
  node and print the landing to stderr so the diagram source stays pure).
- **`src/composition/user-equation.ts` (public):** `parseUserEquation` (splits on
  the first `=`; the RHS's free variables — extracted by the active formula parser
  via `getFormulaParser()`, **MathTS when the peer is installed**, else built-in —
  minus the physics `CONSTANTS` are the sources), `resolveToCatalogName` (links by
  catalog name, trying the literal form then the `_`↔`-` swap so both hyphenated
  `photon-energy` and underscored `impact_parameter` connect), `suggestQuantities`
  (a relevance-gated "did you mean?" by containment + edit distance),
  `equationLanding` (cluster / shared quantities / connected junctions from a built
  `VizModel`), and `UserEquationError`.
- **`user` `VizStatus`** (violet) added to `graph-viz.ts`. The user junction is
  quarantined exactly like `proposed` — only ever an `extraJunction`, never written
  to `CATALOG_GRAPH` / `CANONICAL_GRAPH` / `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS`. No new dependency:
  parsing reuses the existing MathTS-or-built-in formula registry.

## [0.25.0] — 2026-06-19

### Release hygiene

- **Dependency health (release pre-flight):** `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**;
  `npm outdated` → none. **Zero hard dependencies**; the only new dependency this
  release is the **optional** `@viz-js/viz` peer (in `optionalDependencies`, used
  solely by `--format=svg`).
- **Architecture-doc counts refreshed** (`npm run docs:deps`): **178 source files
  · 1281 exports (510 re-exports)**, coverage **164/178 = 92.1%**, suite **2874
  passing across 280 files**, runtime circular deps **0** (2 type-only).

### Added — physics-map visualization (`upt map --format=mermaid|dot|svg`)

- **`buildVizModel` / `edgeToJunction` (`src/composition/graph-viz.ts`, public):**
  turn the composition hypergraph into a **bipartite, clustered** render model —
  round nodes are quantities, box nodes are equations (laws / bridges / proposed)
  as n-ary junctions (sources in, target out) — and serialize it to **Mermaid**
  (`toMermaid()`) and **Graphviz DOT** (`toDot()`) source text. Each connected
  component renders as its own subgraph (the isolated tail grouped into one box),
  so the genuinely disjointed map stays legible; junctions are colored by
  epistemic status (law / established / speculative / highly-speculative /
  proposed). The library computes its own components over the junctions (so a
  proposed overlay participates) and matches the authoritative `linkageMap`
  component count for the pure-edge case (drift-guard test). Pure string output —
  no file I/O. Exported from the public manifest.
- **CLI `upt map --format=text|mermaid|dot [--proposed] [--out=PATH]`**
  (`bin/upt.mjs`): `text` (default) is the unchanged linkage printout;
  `mermaid`/`dot` emit the visual map (reusing the existing
  `--source=catalog|canonical|both`); `--proposed` overlays the unadjudicated
  identity-consequence relations as gray-dashed junctions (the CLI converts
  `ProposedBridge → VizJunction`, so the library never imports `proposed-bridges`
  and the v0.24.0 epistemic firewall stays intact); `--out` writes to a file.
  **Source-only** — no new dependencies and no `child_process` in the shipped
  CLI; SVG is the documented `dot -Tsvg` step.
- **SVG output (`--format=svg`) via the optional `@viz-js/viz` peer:** a new
  public `renderDotToSvg(dot)` (`src/composition/graph-viz-svg.ts`) lazy-loads
  `@viz-js/viz` (the real Graphviz compiled to WebAssembly — same `dot` output,
  in-process, no native binary, no `child_process`) and returns an SVG string;
  `upt map --format=svg` renders the map's DOT layout in one step. The renderer
  is declared in `optionalDependencies` and degrades gracefully — without it
  `--format=svg` throws an actionable `SvgRendererUnavailableError`
  (`npm i @viz-js/viz`, or pipe `--format=dot` through `dot -Tsvg`), and the
  package keeps **zero hard dependencies**. Kept separate from the pure,
  synchronous `graph-viz.ts` so that module stays dependency-free.
- **Docs:** `docs/architecture/PHYSICS_MAP.md` (the canonical layer embedded
  inline as Mermaid + the honest "deliberately disjointed" caption) with the
  committed DOT **and rendered SVG** sources under `docs/architecture/maps/`;
  `cli/README.md` and the root README updated.

### Changed — post-release hygiene (no consumer impact)

- `package.json` `repository.url` normalized to the `git+https://…` form
  (`npm pkg fix`) so `npm publish` no longer auto-corrects it.
- CI: `actions/checkout` / `actions/setup-node` bumped `v4 → v5` (clears the
  deprecated-Node-20 runner warning); test runtime moved Node `20 → 22` (LTS),
  still within `engines: >=18`.

## [0.24.0] — 2026-06-19

### Release hygiene

- **Dependency health (release pre-flight):** `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**;
  `npm outdated` → only `@types/node` behind. Bumped the dev dependency
  `@types/node` `^25.9.1` → `^26.0.0` (latest; build + both typecheck gates clean
  on the new types). No runtime dependencies. Security/correctness/hygiene review
  of the full diff since `v0.23.0` (the identity-consequence surfacer, the
  canonical graph, the CLI flags, the cycle-break refactors) found **no
  Critical/Important issues**: no `eval`/`Function`/`child_process` in the shipped
  artifact (`dist` + `bin/upt.mjs`), CLI regexes are anchored (no ReDoS), the CLI
  assigns only numeric values to plain objects (no prototype-pollution vector),
  and the epistemic firewall (proposals never write `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS` /
  `CANONICAL_GRAPH`) holds.

### Added — canonical-only discovery (run the analysis without bridges)

- **`CANONICAL_GRAPH` / `canonicalToEdges` / `CANONICAL_CONSTANTS`**
  (`src/composition/canonical-graph.ts`): project the standard-physics L-layer
  (`CANONICAL_EQUATIONS`) into the composition-graph edge vocabulary, so the
  existing discovery/analysis funnel can run on textbook physics **alone**, with
  the speculative 44-bridge catalog excluded. The bridge-free counterpart to
  `CATALOG_GRAPH`. Each canonical equation becomes an `established` `law` edge;
  universal constants (G, c, ℏ, k_B, ε₀, σ_sb, b, e, m_e) are **baked into the
  evaluator** (parity with the bridge graph — they are not graph nodes), so the
  candidate proposer stays about physical observables and the numeric filter
  fires from the standard `{ mass }` anchor. Constant-baking is **dimension-
  guarded**: a governing name is baked only if its name *and* dimension match,
  preventing a future same-named variable (e.g. eccentricity `e`) from being
  silently replaced by a constant. The dimensional monomial supplies the power
  law (leading dimensionless constant taken as 1); where dimensions cannot pin a
  monomial (`monomial: null`, e.g. Newton's two same-dim masses) the edge
  carries a NaN evaluator, so `retrodict` abstains rather than polluting the
  consistency check. Exported from the public manifest alongside `CATALOG_GRAPH`.
- **CLI `--source=catalog|canonical|both`** on `upt discover` / `candidates` /
  `map` (`bin/upt.mjs`): `canonical` runs the funnel on standard physics alone;
  `both` uses the bridges plus the canonical established-physics backbone;
  `catalog` (default) is unchanged. `upt discover --source=canonical` surfaces
  textbook-only cross-domain candidates (e.g. `compton-wavelength ≟
  de-broglie-wavelength`) and doubles as a **regression harness**: discovery on
  canonical-only yields **0 `contradictory`** verdicts (standard physics, fed to
  the inference suite, stays self-consistent), pinned in
  `tests/composition/canonical-graph.test.ts`.

### Changed — architecture-doc counts refreshed from the dependency graph

- Re-ran `npm run docs:deps` and reconciled the hand-maintained current-state
  docs against its reports. As shipped in this release the graph reports
  **176 source files · 1259 exports (492 re-exports)**, composition module
  **27 files**, and the live suite **2841 passing across 276 files**
  (coverage 162/176 = 92.0%). Updated `README.md`,
  `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` (stats table, per-module headers, the
  module-distribution table, suite-size line, `package.json` 0.22.0 → 0.23.0),
  and the `docs/architecture/COMPONENTS.md` ASCII module diagram. The generated
  `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` / `TEST_COVERAGE.md` / `dependency-graph.{json,yaml}`
  reports were already current. Historical `docs/planning/*` artifacts are
  point-in-time records and were left unchanged.

### Added — identity-consequence surfacer (`discover --derive`), v0.24.0 pilot

- New internal module `src/composition/proposed-bridges.ts`:
  `deriveProposedBridges()` turns each canonical-only `promising` discovery
  identification into the ONE algebraic relation it implies, by **monomial
  elimination** of the two source equations' `scalarAst` forms. The pilot emits a
  single honest proposal — the "Landauer photon" `ν = (k_B·ln2/h)·T`
  (`[frequency]`, ≈ 4.33 THz at 300 K) — from `erasure-energy ≟ photon-energy`
  (`CE-landauer = CE-planck-einstein`). Surfaced via `upt discover --derive`
  (paired with `--source=canonical`; `propose`/`derive` command names were already
  taken). Pinned by `tests/composition/proposed-bridges.test.ts`.
- A proposal is the algebraic consequence of an **UNADJUDICATED** identification —
  NOT a new relation and NOT a bridge (Part-VI §XXVII-B). Epistemic firewall:
  `ProposedBridge.status` is the literal `'unadjudicated'` (NOT a
  `BridgeEquationStatus`); the type omits every physics-judgment field; the
  generator never writes `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS` (pinned by a reference-identity +
  content-hash test) and proposals never enter `CANONICAL_GRAPH`. Two
  admissibility gates: both sources must have a non-null `dimensional.monomial`
  (determinate) and be `epistemicStatus: 'fully-quantitative'` — the latter gates
  out `CE-jarzynski` (its prefactor is an operator-valued stub), so the pilot is
  one proposal, not two near-duplicates.
- `promoteProposal(proposal, {citation, status, reviewRef})` gates promotion: it
  THROWS `MissingEvidenceError` unless every human input is present (operationalises
  "null, not guessed") and does NOT synthesise a catalog entry.
- New registry accessor `canonicalByTarget(name)` (`src/canonical/registry.ts`).
- **`PROPOSED_BRIDGES` review surface** (`toProposedEntry` / `ProposedBridgeEntry`):
  renders each derived proposal into the catalog's field shape — `name`,
  `category` (`Z` / "Machine-Derived Identity Consequences"), `bridges` (the source
  domains, e.g. `['information','quantum']`), `context`, `formula_latex`,
  `dimensional_signature`, honest `references` (a derivation note + clearly-tagged
  SOURCE-equation citations, never a fabricated citation for the derived relation),
  and `known_issues` — but in its OWN registry with `status: 'unadjudicated'`.
  `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS` stays the faithful 44-bridge spec encoding and is never
  mutated (per the chosen "separate surface" disposition; the Landauer photon is a
  dimensional coincidence, not spec physics).
- **Widened scope + bridge-source adapter:** `deriveProposedBridges()` is
  candidate-set-agnostic (`discover --derive` forwards whichever
  `--source=catalog|canonical|both` graph is selected), and a new `EquationSource`
  abstraction (`resolveSource`) now resolves each endpoint to a canonical equation
  OR a **bridge edge** with a clean-monomial `symbolic` form. Bridge `confidence`
  is recorded, not gated (it is about framing, not formula completeness); the
  closed-prefactor requirement is enforced structurally (`hasNonConstantStub`).
  At `--source=both` the BE-16 bridge now independently derives the Landauer photon
  (`IC-landauer-erasure-energy--photon-energy--nu`) alongside the canonical one.
  Remaining honest boundary: bridge targets with no `symbolic` form, a non-monomial
  form (BE-33), or ambiguous multi-edge targets (BE-42 Hawking) are skipped. The
  CLI evaluates each proposal from its own free leaves.
- **`dedupByNormalForm`:** collapses proposals that derive the same relation (equal
  `normalForm` up to dimensionless constants AND equal target dimension) into one,
  recording the collapsed identifications in `alsoDerivableFrom` (Design §9 #2).
- **More bridge `symbolic` forms (5 → 8 edges):** added drift-guarded clean-monomial
  symbolic forms to **BE-51** (`α = 4GM/(bc²)`), **BE-18** (`m_dark = g·v`), and
  **BE-20** (`ρ_Λ = c²Λ/(8πG)`) so they can source derivations. BE-18 unlocks a
  genuinely new proposal at `--source=both`: `temperature = vev·yukawa/(k_B·ln2)`
  from `dark-fermion-mass ≟ erasure-energy`.
- **Source enumeration / de-ambiguation:** `resolveSources` now returns ALL
  admissible sources for a target (every canonical equation + every clean-monomial
  bridge edge), and the generator enumerates source pairs (`derivePair`) with id
  disambiguation. A multi-edge target like BE-42 Hawking's two parametrisations is
  de-ambiguated by enumeration rather than skipped; coincidences collapse under
  dedup. The closed-prefactor gate (`hasNonConstantStub`) was refined to treat a
  dimensionless *input* quantity (BE-18's `yukawa-coupling`) as legitimate while
  still rejecting operator stubs (Jarzynski's `ln_avg_exp_minus_betaW`).
- **Leaf-name canonicalization:** a canonical equation's `scalarAst` private
  symbols are aligned to its governing quantity names (`T → temperature`) via
  `leafCanonMap`/`renameLeaves` (unique dimension match only — never guessed). This
  is the vocabulary bridge `symbolic` forms already use, so at `--source=both` the
  canonical (`CE-landauer`) and bridge (`BE-16`) Landauer-photon derivations now
  collapse into ONE proposal carrying `alsoDerivableFrom:
  ['landauer-erasure-energy ≡ photon-energy']`. The CLI prints the "also derivable
  from" provenance.
- **Spec write-up:** `docs/specification/Part-XI-Proposed-Equations.md` (indexed in
  the spec README + CHANGELOG) — a NON-NORMATIVE catalog of the surfacer's
  machine-derived candidate relations (PE-1 Landauer photon, PE-2 dark-fermion /
  erasure temperature), held OUT of `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS` pending §XXVII-B review.
- Design, plan, and the Adam+Eve adversarial review under
  `docs/planning/v0.24.0-{Design,Implementation-Plan,Review-Findings}.md`.

### Added — declared compton↔de-Broglie link + canonical-only baseline note

- Registered `de-broglie-wavelength → compton-wavelength` in
  `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS` (`src/composition/compose.ts`). The Compton
  wavelength is the de Broglie wavelength in the relativistic limit `p = mc`, so
  at the composition graph's quantity-KIND resolution they name one matter-
  wavelength node. Folded ONTO `compton-wavelength` (the anchor-determinable,
  sourced node) so the genuine `planck-length ≟ compton-wavelength` scale clash
  survives the magnitude gate. Effect on `--source=canonical`: the
  correspondence moves from a re-discovered `promising` candidate to a declared
  link, de-Broglie's edge joins the anchored cluster (cluster 15 → 16 edges; map
  12 → 11 components), and the funnel drops to 33 candidates → 2 promising, still
  0 contradictory. No bridge uses either name, so the bridge composition engine
  is unaffected. Pinned in `tests/composition/canonical-graph.test.ts`.
- Added `docs/research/v0.23.0-canonical-only-baseline.md` (indexed in
  `docs/research/README.md`): the canonical-equation L-layer run on its own as
  the standard-physics consistency baseline — 11 map components, funnel 33 → 2
  flagged coincidences (`erasure-energy`/`free-energy-difference ≟
  photon-energy`) · 5 genuine clashes · 0 contradictory — recording the three
  2026-06-18 discovery-quality fixes.

### Changed — unified canonical variable names (de-fragments the graph)

- Renamed the fragmented governing-variable aliases in `src/canonical/entries/*`
  to the shared graph vocabulary: **`T` → `temperature`** (Landauer, Jarzynski,
  Stefan–Boltzmann, ideal-gas, Wien) and **`M` → `mass`** (Hawking, light-
  deflection, perihelion). Newton's `m_1`/`m_2` became `mass`/`secondary-mass` —
  not both `mass`, because `buckinghamPi` requires unique governing names and the
  two distinct masses are exactly the free mass-ratio that keeps Newton's
  `monomial: null`. Only the `dimensional.governing` names changed; the
  `scalarAst` leaf symbols are left as-is so `normalForm`/linkage (and the
  `restates-canonical` recoveries) are unaffected. Effect on `--source=canonical`:
  the linkage map de-fragments (14 → 12 components; anchored cluster 8 → 15 edges;
  composition chains 1 → 5) and discovery drops the namespace-artifact candidates
  (`mass ≟ m_1`, `mass ≟ m_2`, `temperature ≟ T`) — funnel 66 → 44 candidates,
  still 0 contradictory. Pinned in `tests/composition/canonical-graph.test.ts`.

### Fixed — discovery magnitude gate false-rejected atomic-scale links

- Added sourced representative values for `compton-wavelength` (2.43e-12 m) and
  `bohr-radius` (5.29e-11 m) to `src/composition/representative-values.ts`. The
  magnitude gate previously had no sourced value for these, so it fell back to
  evaluating them at the `{ mass: M_sun }` anchor — which makes a `1/mass`
  quantity like the Compton wavelength absurdly small (~10⁻⁷³ m) and produced a
  spurious ~61-order `magnitude-clash` against the (fixed) Bohr radius. With real
  magnitudes the gate sees the two atomic scales ~1 order apart and no longer
  falsifies the link (it becomes `inert`). The genuine clashes
  (`planck-length ≟ bohr-radius` ~24 orders, etc.) are unaffected. Surfaced by
  running `upt discover --source=canonical`; pinned in
  `tests/composition/canonical-graph.test.ts`.

### Added — CLI documentation

- **`cli/README.md`**: a full reference for the `upt` command-line tool — all 15
  commands and their aliases, the `--source=catalog|canonical|both` flag, the
  three ways to run it, input syntax, flags, exit codes, and troubleshooting.
  The root README's Quick Start now links to it and lists the `canonical` /
  `recover` / `discover --source=canonical` commands.

## [0.23.0] — 2026-06-18

Dependency health (release pre-flight): `npm audit` → 0 vulnerabilities;
`npm outdated` → none. No dependency changes in this release.

### Added — canonical tranche growth (general relativity)

- Three standard-physics GR canonical entries: **Hawking temperature**
  `T_H = ℏc³/(8πGMk_B)` (restates bridge 42 — a 2nd F4 `restates-canonical` with
  exact numerical recovery), **Eddington light-deflection** `α = 4GM/(c²b)`
  (partners bridge 51), and **Einstein perihelion precession**
  `Δφ = 6πGM/(c²a(1−e²))` (partners bridge 52). Registry 22 → 25 entries;
  coverage gap 39 → 37; `restates-canonical` links 1 → 2.

### Added — Jarzynski canonical partner (BE-29)

- **`CE-jarzynski`** (`ΔF = −k_B T ln⟨exp(−W/k_B T)⟩`, domain `statistical`,
  `epistemicStatus: 'scalar-up-to-constant'`): the L-layer partner BE-29 lacked.
  `restatesBridge: '29'`, so the scan reports `CE-jarzynski ≡ bridge 29` as a
  declared restatement (BE-29's own ground truth). Registry 25 → 26 entries;
  coverage gap 37 → 36; `restates-canonical` links 2 → 3.
  See `docs/research/BE-29-Landauer-Recovery.md`.

### Changed — normal-form stub-identity tagging

- `normalForm` (`src/canonical/normal-form.ts`) now distinguishes a dimensionless
  **constant** (numeric literal, registered constant `ln2`/`4pi`, spelled-out
  `\d*pi`/`ln_2_constant`) from a dimensionless **stub** (any other named
  dimensionless symbol — a parameter or a functional like `ln⟨e^−βW⟩`). Constants
  stay droppable "up to a factor"; stubs are kept as distinct `stub:<name>` tokens.
  Effect: the two BE-29 form-coincidences (`CE-landauer ~ 29`, `CE-jarzynski ~ 16`)
  demote from `recovers` to `dimensional-only` (ln2 ≠ ln⟨e^−βW⟩ — a substantive
  factor, not a constant), while the three declared restatements (Landauer↔16,
  Hawking↔42, Jarzynski↔29) are preserved. **This supersedes the [0.22.0] note
  below describing `Landauer ~ bridge 29` as a `recovers`.**

### Changed — discovery funnel hardening

- `discover` magnitude gate now falls back to a quantity's value **at the
  registered anchor** (via `forwardEvaluate`) when the static representative-value
  table has no entry — so graph-derived quantities (`schwarzschild-radius`,
  `thermal-de-broglie-wavelength`) stop abstaining, falsifying scale-clashes like
  `schwarzschild-radius ≟ foerster-radius` and `mass ≟ planck-mass`.
- A generic↔specialization identification whose one name is a strict hyphen-token
  subset of the other (`mass` ⊂ `reference-mass`) is barred from `promising`
  (demoted to inert) as near-tautological.
- Sourced BE-24/BE-26 representative values added (`donor-acceptor-distance` ~5 nm,
  `barrier-width` ~1 Å, `barrier-height` ~0.2 eV, `tunneling-mass` = proton);
  speculative-scale quantities deliberately keep abstaining (documented).
- Net real-graph funnel: **23 → 12 promising · 6 → 20 magnitude-clash**.

### Docs

- Regenerated the dependency-graph + test-coverage reports (`npm run docs:deps`)
  and refreshed the drifted hand-written stats in ARCHITECTURE / COMPONENTS /
  README / CLAUDE: 173 source files, 8 modules (the `canonical` module is now
  documented), 1236 exports, suite ~2796. Added a COMPONENTS Canonical-Module
  section + the `BE-29-Landauer-Recovery.md` research note.

### Deferred — composition-derived recovery

- Extending linkage from "bridge RHS *equals* a canonical up to a factor" to "a
  *composed chain* derives a canonical" is **deferred as premature**: only 5 of
  41 composition edges carry a symbolic form, and the one registered chain (CT-1,
  Hawking-temp ∘ Landauer) composes to a mass-expression that matches no canonical.
  Revisit once symbolic-form coverage and the canonical tranche grow.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-06-18

Dependency health (release pre-flight): `npm audit` → 0 vulnerabilities;
`npm outdated` → none. No dependency changes in this release.

### Added — bridge↔canonical linkage + discovery kinds + CLI (Sub-projects B/C/D)

- **B — `src/canonical/linkage.ts`**: validate bridges against standard physics.
  `normalForm` (`src/canonical/normal-form.ts`) is a structural hash *up to
  dimensionless multiplicative factors* (flatten products, drop dimensionless
  factors, sort commutative operands, keep exponents). `classifyLinkage` /
  `scanLinkages` compare each canonical scalar-AST against each bridge RHS:
  dimensional + structural + best-effort numerical recovery (agreement up to a
  constant factor). The **F4 circularity guard**: a structural match is
  `restates-canonical` (a trivial X≡X, NOT a discovery) only when the canonical's
  `restatesBridge` names that bridge; otherwise it's a genuine `recovers`. Real
  scan: Landauer ≡ bridge 16 (`restates-canonical`, recovery exact); Landauer ~
  bridge 29 Jarzynski (`recovers` — both are `energy = k_B·T·dimensionless`); 17
  `dimensional-only`. Exported from the package root.
- **C — discovery canonical kinds**: `VettedCandidate` gains `canonicalKinds`
  (standard-physics domains whose canonical *target* shares the candidate's
  dimension — the alignable axis across the two namespaces) and `touchesCanonical`
  (an endpoint is a canonical quantity name). Both additive/informational — no
  verdict or score change.
- **D — CLI**: `upt canonical` lists the registry (fidelity, domain, partners,
  coverage gap); `upt recover` runs the linkage scan, grouping
  `restates-canonical` / `recovers` / `dimensional-only`.

### Added — canonical-equation registry (Sub-project A)

- New `src/canonical/` module: a `CanonicalEquation` type and queryable registry
  (`CANONICAL_EQUATIONS`, `CANONICAL_BY_ID`, `canonicalById`, `canonicalByDomain`)
  — the ground-truth L-layer of the tensor (Π = L + B + E), the textbook *answer
  key* that bridge equations are validated against. Entries carry multi-fidelity
  encodings (L0 dimensional / L1 scalar-AST / L2 field-equation) plus
  epistemic-honesty fields (`epistemicStatus`, `freeDimensionlessGroups`) and
  provenance (`restatesBridge`, `partnerBridges`). Design + Adam/Eve review:
  `docs/planning/Canonical-Equation-Registry-A-*.md`.
- **22 canonical entries** seeded: 9 dimensional classics (pendulum, Kepler III,
  Schwarzschild radius, string wave speed, Planck length/mass/time, Compton,
  thermal de Broglie); L1 gravity/thermo (Bekenstein–Hawking area-form, Landauer,
  Newton, Stefan–Boltzmann flux, ideal gas); L1 quantum/EM (Coulomb,
  Planck–Einstein, de Broglie, Bohr radius, Wien, Lorentz-force magnitude); the
  Einstein field equation at L2 (a validated `EinsteinFieldEquationNode`) and the
  Friedmann equation at L1.
- L0 fields (`monomial`, `freeDimensionlessGroups`) are **derived from the
  Buckingham-π engine** so they are consistent by construction
  (`monomial !== null ⟺ freeDimensionlessGroups === 0`). Forms dimensions cannot
  pin (Newton, Coulomb, Bekenstein–Hawking) carry a free group; their scalar-AST
  is the authority. Numeric-prefactor tests guard area-vs-radius, log-base, and
  flux-vs-power slips that dimensional validation cannot catch.
- `seedCanonicalLaws` + `canonicalToLaw` populate the (previously empty) tensor
  L-layer; `CANONICAL_TENSOR_CONFIG` provides axes covering every canonical
  regime. Coverage helpers (`partneredBridgeIds`, `bridgesWithoutCanonicalPartner`)
  log the 39 catalog bridges that still lack a canonical correspondence partner.
- Added constants `epsilon_0`, derived `sigma_sb`, `h` (Planck), and `b` (Wien
  displacement, new `B_WIEN_SI`) to `src/composition/symbolic-constants.ts` so the
  Coulomb/Bohr/Stefan–Boltzmann/Planck–Einstein/de-Broglie/Wien scalar-ASTs
  evaluate numerically, not just dimensionally. The full registry is re-exported
  from the package root.

### Added — discovery order-of-magnitude falsifier

- `discover` now applies a **magnitude gate**: an identification `a ≡ b` is
  rejected as a new `magnitude-clash` verdict when both quantities have a
  representative value and those values differ by more than N orders of
  magnitude (`DiscoveryOptions.maxOrdersOfMagnitude`, default 3). This is the
  falsifier the single-anchor `retrodict` check structurally cannot make — it
  cannot evaluate the quantities a dimensional coincidence "unlocks", so it
  never contradicts them. New `src/composition/representative-values.ts` holds a
  sourced, order-of-magnitude table (`REPRESENTATIVE_VALUES` + `representativeValue`)
  for **scale-specific quantities only** — generic `mass`/`energy`/`length` are
  intentionally absent (no single representative scale → the gate abstains).
- It is a **partial** falsifier: it abstains (`magnitudeChecked: false`,
  `ordersApart: null`) whenever either value is unknown, so it never
  false-rejects on missing data. On the real catalog it falsifies 6 scale-clash
  decoys (e.g. `landauer-erasure-energy ≟ planck-mass-energy` ~29.8 orders)
  while correctly leaving genuinely close coincidences
  (`grw-localization-rate ≟ hubble-rate` ~1.7 orders) for physicist review.
- `VettedCandidate` gains `ordersApart` and `magnitudeChecked`; `upt discover`
  reports the `magnitude-clash` group with the orders-apart gap. The
  representative-value table is injectable via `DiscoveryOptions.representativeValues`
  so the forthcoming canonical-equation registry can supply it centrally.

### Fixed

- `bin/upt.mjs` failed to load on Windows (`Could not load the built package` /
  `Only URLs with a scheme in: file, data, and node are supported … Received
  protocol 'c:'`). Node's ESM dynamic `import()` rejects bare absolute Windows
  paths; the `dist()` path helper now returns a `file://` URL via `pathToFileURL`.
  All 13 CLI subcommands (`audit`, `predict`, `discover`, `coverage`, …) now run
  on Windows.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-06-17

### Changed — BE-26 (DNA tunneling): faithful Gamow-exponential re-encoding

- The first real-bridge use of the v0.20 differentiable definite integral. BE-26's
  WKB exponent `(2/ℏ)∫√(2m(V−E))dx` now carries explicit barrier-endpoint bounds
  `x₁, x₂` (definite integral), and the Gamow factor is encoded as
  `transcendental(exp, −1·WKB)` instead of an `exp(-WKB_arg)` symbol stub. Because
  the integrand `√(2m(V−E))` is constant in x (`V_minus_E` is a constant ENERGY
  symbol, not `V(x)`), 16-pt Gauss–Legendre is **exact** and equals
  `√(2m(V−E))·(x₂−x₁)` — matching the canonical rectangular-barrier evaluator
  (asserted to <1e-9 rel. err.).
- `bridgeGradientASTById('BE-26', …)` now differentiates the tunneling rate
  **exactly** w.r.t. m, V_minus_E, x₁, x₂ (physical signs verified: ∂Γ/∂m,
  ∂Γ/∂(V−E), ∂Γ/∂x₂ < 0; the `f(T,pH,EM)` interpolation factor stays an opaque
  stub). The `exp` of the DIMENSIONLESS WKB exponent is DIMENSIONLESS, so the
  round-trip dimensional_signature (`[frequency]`) is unchanged.
- Adam + Eve both GREEN; both noted the encoding is *more* honest than the prior
  bound-less integral (which implied a `V(x)` generality the `V_minus_E` symbol
  never had). Domain guards (caller's): `V_minus_E ≥ 0`, `m > 0`, `x₂ ≥ x₁`
  (Eve: `∂Γ/∂x₁ = −∂Γ/∂x₂`, verified).

### Dep-health (release pre-flight)

- `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added — differentiable definite integrals (`integral` node + Gauss–Legendre)

- The `integral` node gains **optional** `lower`/`upper` bound fields. With bounds
  it is a *definite* integral: numerically evaluable and reverse-mode-AD
  differentiable. Bound-less integrals are unchanged (abstract / dimensional-only;
  existing BE-26, BE-44 unaffected).
- New `src/numerical/quadrature.ts` — 16-point Gauss–Legendre (`integrateGaussLegendre`,
  `GAUSS_LEGENDRE_16`). Both the numerical lowering and the traced AD lowering
  evaluate `∫ₐᵇ f dx ≈ (b−a)/2·Σ wᵢ·f(xᵢ)`, scope-binding the integration variable
  to each abscissa.
- `bridgeGradientAST` now differentiates definite integrals: the Leibniz
  parameter-gradient `∂/∂θ ∫ f dx = ∫ ∂f/∂θ dx` and the boundary-term
  bound-gradient `∂/∂b`. Built from traced ops so AD handles both with no
  special-casing; a scoped bound-variable environment supports **nested** `∫∫`.
  `astDifferentiableBridgeIds`/coverage predicate accept bounded integrals.
- Validator: definite-integral bounds must match the integration variable's
  dimension; the integral's dimension is `dim(integrand)·dim(over)` as before.

**Honesty (Adam-vetted):** the gradient is **exact for the quadrature**, which
*approximates* the true integral for non-polynomial integrands (exact for constant
or polynomial-degree-≤31 integrands; the bound-gradient `∂Q/∂b` likewise
approximates `f(b)` exactly only in that regime). Fixed n=16 GL is unreliable for
highly oscillatory integrands or singularities at the bounds — out of scope.
Differentiating w.r.t. the integration variable is rejected.

Note: BE-26 (WKB `∫√(2m(V−E))dx`) could now be re-encoded with explicit barrier
bounds to expose m, V−E (its `f(T,pH,EM)` interpolation factor stays a stub) — that
is a per-bridge physics-modelling decision, deferred to its own change.

### Clarified — dimensionful fractional powers were never actually "deferred"

The v0.18.0/v0.19.0 notes described `sqrt`/`cbrt` of a **dimensionful** quantity as
deferred, "needing rational-exponent Dimension algebra." That was inaccurate, and
this corrects the record:

- The `Dimension` exponents are already `number` (the algebra was built for rational
  exponents), and `^` with a **numeric-literal** exponent already works on a
  dimensionful base — `(m)^0.5` validates to `[M^0.5]`, lowers numerically, and is
  exactly differentiable (`TapedTensor.pow(k)` handles fractional `k`). BE-12
  (thermal de Broglie `λ_T ∝ T^(−1/2)`) has been exactly AD-differentiable all
  along. New regression guard: `tests/dimensional/dimensionful-power-ad.test.ts`.
- What does *not* exist is a dedicated `sqrt`/`cbrt` **node**, but that would be
  pure ergonomic sugar (redundant with `^0.5` / `^(1/3)`) — not a capability gap.
- The genuinely un-AD-able bridges (BE-26, BE-29, BE-38, and structurally BE-17/20/44)
  are blocked by **non-scalar structure** — integrals (BE-26 WKB `∫√…dx`), ensemble
  averages (BE-29 `⟨…⟩`), interpolation-function stubs (BE-26 `f()`, BE-38 `ν(z)`),
  tensors (BE-17), and special nodes (BE-20/44) — not by fractional powers.
  `bridgeGradientNumerical` already serves their gradients (finite differences over
  the plain-JS evaluator). Closed-form AST-AD for those is research-level
  (differentiating integrals / interpolations) and out of scope.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added — `abs` scalar-AST node

- New `ExprNode` member `{ kind: 'abs', arg }` — absolute value `|x|`. Unlike the
  transcendentals, abs is **dimension-preserving** (`[|x|] = [x]`), so it gets its
  own node rather than being a `TranscendentalFn`. Wired through the validator,
  numerical lowering (`Math.abs`), traced AD lowering (→ `TapedTensor.abs`,
  adjoint `sign(x)`), and the coverage predicate. Lets bridges encode `|φ−φ₀|`
  etc. with the inner variables visible to differentiation.

### Changed — faithful re-encodings (BE-25, BE-40, BE-41, BE-45, BE-46)

The remaining transcendental-stub bridges whose expansion **exposes real
variables** (Adam's guideline) are now encoded with grammar nodes instead of
opaque typed-stub symbols, so `bridgeGradientASTById` differentiates them exactly:

- **BE-25** (IIT Φ): `log2_ratio_ii` stub → `transcendental(log2, p_cond/p_marg)`.
- **BE-40** (composite Higgs): the `sin²`/`sin⁴`/`sin²cos²` stubs → `sin`/`cos`
  `transcendental` nodes over `h/f`.
- **BE-41** (Swampland): `exp(−α|φ−φ₀|/M_P)` stub → `transcendental(exp, …)` with
  the new `abs` node, exposing α, φ, φ₀, M_P.
- **BE-45** (TCC): the two `log(…)` stubs → `transcendental(ln, …)` (natural log,
  matching the evaluator) over the exposed dimensionless ratios.
- **BE-46** (anthropic measure): `exp_factor` stub → `transcendental(exp, −α/Λ)`.

All are dimension-preserving, so every bridge's round-trip `format(infer(rhs))`
== `dimensional_signature` is unchanged (the 42-bridge round-trip still passes).

### Not expanded (genuinely not exposable)

- **BE-29** (ln⟨e^(−βW)⟩) — the ensemble average stays an opaque stub.
- **BE-26** (DNA tunneling) — its WKB argument has `sqrt` of a *dimensionful*
  quantity (the deferred rational-exponent case) plus an interpolation-function
  stub `f(T,pH,EM)`. **BE-38** likewise carries an interpolation stub `ν(z)`.

### Dep-health (release pre-flight)

- `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added — `transcendental` scalar-AST node (widens exact-AD coverage)

- New `ExprNode` member `{ kind: 'transcendental', fn, arg }` + the `@public`
  `TranscendentalFn` type (`exp`/`ln`/`log2`/`log10`/`sin`/`cos`/`tan`/`sinh`/
  `cosh`/`tanh`). Dimensional rule: the argument must be **dimensionless** and the
  result is **dimensionless** (a function's Taylor series only sums across like
  dimensions when its argument is dimensionless); a tensor argument is rejected.
  Wired through the dimension validator, the numerical lowering (`Math.*`), the
  traced AD lowering (→ `mathts-autograd` `TapedTensor` methods — finally
  exercising the 0.2.0 transcendental ops), and the `astDifferentiableBridgeIds`
  coverage predicate.
- This lets bridges encode `exp`/`log`/`trig` of a real sub-expression instead of
  an opaque typed-stub symbol, so the **inner variables become visible to
  differentiation**. Grammar design vetted by Adam (YELLOW → addressed: see
  deferral below; and the "only expand a stub if it exposes the inner variables"
  guideline, which governed the re-encoding batch).

### Changed — faithful re-encodings (BE-37, BE-34)

- **BE-37 (Shapiro delay):** the `ln_R_ratio` stub symbol → `transcendental(ln,
  R_far/R_near)`. `bridgeGradientASTById('BE-37', 'R_far'|'R_near', …)` now gives
  the exact ∂Δt/∂R.
- **BE-34 (Kibble-Zurek):** the `exp(−m c²/(k_B T_reh))` stub symbol →
  `transcendental(exp, −1 · (m c²/(k_B T_reh)))`, exposing m_defect, c, k_B, T_reh.
- Both are dimension-preserving (the transcendental factor stays dimensionless), so
  every bridge's round-trip `format(infer(rhs))` == `dimensional_signature` is
  unchanged (the 42-bridge round-trip test still passes).

### Deferred

- `sqrt`/`cbrt` of a **dimensionful** argument (`D ↦ D^(1/2)`) is intentionally NOT
  part of this node — it needs rational-exponent Dimension algebra, a separate
  foundational change. Adam flagged this; it is logged as a follow-up.

### Dep-health (release pre-flight)

- `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added — by-id bridge gradients + an RHS-AST registry

- `src/bridges/rhs-registry.ts`: `BRIDGE_RHS_BY_ID` — one `id → RHS ExprNode` map
  for all 42 AST-encoded bridges (ids 11–50, 53, 54), plus `parseBridgeId`
  (accepts `42`, `'42'`, `'BE-42'`). Previously this id↔RHS mapping was duplicated
  inside the dimensional round-trip test; it's now a single source of truth.
- `bridgeGradientASTById(bridgeId, varName, bindings)` (`@public`): the ergonomic
  entry point requested as a follow-up — `bridgeGradientASTById('BE-42', 'M', { M })`
  resolves the RHS from the registry and delegates to `bridgeGradientAST`. Throws
  for ids with no encoded AST (e.g. BE-51/52, closed-form).
- `astDifferentiableBridgeIds()` (`@public`): returns the catalogued bridge ids
  whose encoded RHS is entirely in the differentiable scalar grammar
  (`symbol` + `op(+ − * / ^)`) — i.e. those `bridgeGradientASTById` differentiates
  exactly. Bridges encoded with integral/tensor/curvature nodes (or whose physics
  hides behind a typed-stub symbol) are excluded.

### Changed

- `tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts` now derives its cases from
  `BRIDGE_RHS_BY_ID` instead of re-listing 42 imports (−92 lines), so the round-trip
  both validates each encoding and guards the registry against drift.

### Dep-health (release pre-flight)

- `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added — `bridgeGradientAST` (exact bridge gradients via AD over the RHS AST)

- `bridgeGradientAST(rhs, varName, bindings)` + `ASTGradientResult` (both
  `@public`, exported from `src/index.ts`): reverse-mode automatic
  differentiation of a bridge's **symbolic RHS AST** (`*_RHS: ExprNode`),
  lowered through `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd`'s `TapedTensor` ops. The
  chosen variable is bound to a traced input; every other symbol resolves to a
  constant tape leaf (caller `bindings` → named physical constants → numeric
  literal). The gradient is **exact** (machine precision), not a finite-
  difference approximation — and the plain-JS evaluators stay untouched (P8
  Decision #1). Requires the optional mathts-autograd peer (throws
  `EngineCapabilityError` when absent).
- Scope: the dimensional scalar grammar is `symbol` + `op(+ − * / ^)` —
  transcendentals are absorbed into typed-stub *symbols*, so a stub-encoded
  bridge differentiates with respect to its stub; faithfully-expanded encodings
  (e.g. BE-42 `ℏc³/(8πGM·k_B)`) differentiate exactly. `^` exponents must be
  constant. Validated on BE-42 (`dT_H/dM = −T_H/M`, exact) and cross-checked
  against both the plain-JS evaluator and `bridgeGradientNumerical`; gradient
  accumulation for repeated-variable expressions is covered.

  This closes the long-standing "bridge gradients aren't AD-differentiable" gap
  for faithfully-encoded bridges — the payoff for the
  `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd@0.2.0` op-surface work. (`bridgeGradient`'s
  engine path remains unable to trace the plain-JS evaluators; `bridgeGradientAST`
  is the AD answer, `bridgeGradientNumerical` the general fallback.)

### Changed

- Bump the optional `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd` peer floor `^0.1.1` →
  `^0.2.0` (currency; the traced lowering uses `divide`/`pow`/`mul`/`add`, all
  present since 0.1.x, so this is hygiene, not a hard requirement).

### Dep-health (release pre-flight)

- `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added — `bridgeGradientNumerical` (the supported bridge-gradient path)

- `bridgeGradientNumerical(spec, params, opts?)` + `BridgeNumericalGradientResult`
  (both `@public`, exported from `src/index.ts`): a **central finite-difference**
  gradient for the catalog's plain-JS bridge evaluators. Engine-free and
  synchronous. Relative step `h = max(|x|,1)·cbrt(eps)` (the central-diff optimum;
  `sqrt(eps)` is the forward-diff optimum) with the representable-denominator trick
  `dx = (x+h)−(x−h)` so the perturbation survives rounding at astrophysical scales
  (e.g. `M ≈ 2e30 kg`). Same param-validation contract as `bridgeGradient`; gradient
  returned keyed by `paramName`. Design vetted by Adam (YELLOW→addressed: cbrt-eps
  step). Closes the long-skipped real-gradient test placeholder.

### Fixed — honest AD-limitation framing for `bridgeGradient`

- `bridgeGradient` (reverse/forward-mode AD) **cannot** differentiate the plain-JS
  catalog evaluators — empirically it throws even with `MathTSEngine` + autograd
  (the `TapedTensor` does not survive `engine.toNested`; tape/dual AD only sees
  engine-traced ops). Corrected the previously-optimistic comments in
  `bridge-gradient.ts`, `index.ts`, and the test suite that implied installing the
  autograd peer would make AD work. Documented the two distinct failure modes
  (peer-absent → `EngineCapabilityError`; peer-present → still throws).
- Replaced the `describe.skipIf(true)` placeholder (`expect(true).toBe(true)`) with
  real analytic cross-checks: BE-42 Hawking `dT_H/dM = −T_H/M`; BE-11 decoherence
  multi-param `γ = γ₀(λ/λ₀)²`; plus a MathTSEngine regression guard that documents
  the AD limitation. Suite **2625 passing** (+5).

### Tooling — plan-doc audit excludes Brainstorm docs

- `tools/plan-doc-audit` (a non-shipped dev tool) now skips `*-Brainstorm.md`
  ("not promises" idea lists, not completion ledgers) via the new
  `isAuditablePlanDoc` predicate — a brainstorm item naming an existing symbol as
  the TARGET of a gated/future task (e.g. PO-2 `pderiv` opt, NOT implemented) was
  being mis-flagged flip-eligible. Flipped 7 audit-verified-complete checkboxes in
  the v0.2.0/v0.3.0 implementation-plans + findings. `audit:plans` dry-run now
  exits 0.

### Dep-health (release pre-flight)

- `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities** (unchanged from 0.14.0; no dependency
  changes in this release).

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-16

**Single rollup release at final HEAD** — the first npm publish since `0.7.3`.
Subsumes the milestone sections `[0.8.0]` … `[0.11.0]` below (all marked
UNRELEASED — they were never individually published) plus the v0.12 / v0.13 /
v0.14 work recorded in this section (precedent: `0.7.0` rolled up `0.6.1`). The
`package.json` version field, which had lagged at `0.10.0` while feature work
reached v0.14, is reconciled to `0.14.0` here.

**Dep-health snapshot (release pre-flight):** `npm audit` → **0 vulnerabilities**.
Optional `@danielsimonjr/mathts-*` peers updated to latest in-range and the full
suite re-validated against them: autograd 0.1.3, core 0.1.4, expression 0.2.4,
functions 0.2.7, matrix 0.1.6, parallel 0.2.2, tensor 0.1.3, wasm 0.1.3,
workerpool 0.2.0; dev `vitest` 4.1.9. Gates green on Node: `tsc` (src), `tsc -p
tsconfig.tests.json` (strict), `vitest run` (**2620 passing**, 5 intentional
skips + 1 todo), the `GL4_LONG=1` release-prep tier (8 passing), and `smoke`.

### Added — `LabeledTensor.mergeAxes` / `splitAxis` (rank-changing reshape)

Closes the long-deferred rank-changing-reshape gap (`RankPreservationError`'s
"a future `mergeAxes` / `splitAxis` helper" promise). Built on the new explicit
`axisOrder` invariant; design + Adam (design) + Eve (implementation) vet:
`docs/planning/v0.14-MergeAxes-SplitAxis-Design.md`.

- `mergeAxes(keys, merged)` fuses a CONTIGUOUS run of ENGINE axes into one axis
  carrying a caller-supplied label (rank R → R−(k−1)); `splitAxis(key, parts)` is
  the inverse (rank R → R+(parts−1)). Both are pure `engine.reshape` +
  label/axisOrder bookkeeping; the caller owns the new axis identities (no
  composite-id synthesized).
- Axes are addressed in ENGINE-axis space via `axisOf` (not sorted keys), so
  `mergeAxes` is correct on a transposed OR contract-derived (non-sorted)
  `axisOrder` — the contiguity check is over engine positions, which is the only
  run `engine.reshape` (storage-adjacent fusion) can losslessly merge.
- New `@public` errors `AxisMergeError` / `AxisSplitError` (exported, in the
  runtime surface). Guards: <2 keys/parts, unknown key, non-contiguous run,
  duplicate keys, key/id collision with a surviving axis, non-integer/non-positive
  part size, size-product mismatch (pre-engine), and — Eve Y1 — two split parts
  sharing one id (which would otherwise build a `contract`-illegal tensor).
- 15 tests: data-identity merge/split, transposed-tensor merge, merge-on-contract-
  result, merge-all→rank-1, uneven split (6→[2,3]), merged-key-reuse, full error
  surface, and merge∘split / split∘merge round-trips. Full suite **2620 passing**
  (+15); tsc src + tests, build, smoke clean.

### Fixed — `LabeledTensor` explicit axis-order invariant (foundation)

Replaces the implicit "engine axis = sorted-key position" assumption with an
explicit, authoritative `axisOrder` field, fixing a latent desync that `transpose`
and `contract` could introduce. Design + Adam (GREEN) + Eve (YELLOW→resolved):
`docs/planning/v0.14-LabeledTensor-AxisOrder-Design.md`. The prerequisite the
`mergeAxes`/`splitAxis` vet surfaced — now unblocking that follow-up.

- **The defect:** `transpose` permuted the engine axes but returned unchanged
  labels; since `canonicalLabelOrder` sorts the same keys to the same order, the
  engine-axis order silently diverged from the assumed sorted order. `contract`
  independently could diverge — it built the result tensor in einsum-free-emission
  order but mapped labels via sorted keys. Latent (no shipped consumer does
  transpose-then-contract), so this is correctness-enablement, not an active-bug
  fix.
- **The fix:** a `public readonly axisOrder: readonly string[]` (label keys in
  engine-axis order) maintained by every operation, plus `axisOf(key): number`
  as the safe label→position accessor. The constructor takes an OPTIONAL 4th
  `axisOrder` param defaulting to `canonicalLabelOrder` (sorted) — fully
  backward-compatible (every existing 3-arg caller builds sorted-order tensors;
  the sole src consumer is rank-1). `transpose` now computes its permutation
  against the current `axisOrder` and sets the result's order; `contract` maps
  via each operand's `axisOrder` and emits a parallel `resultAxisOrder`;
  `reshape` carries `axisOrder` through. New `AxisOrderError` (`@public`) for a
  non-permutation `axisOrder`.
- **Eve Y1 (bundled bug fix):** the `contract` key-collision suffix only guarded
  the un-suffixed key, so it could overwrite an existing suffixed key (duplicate
  result key). Now it loops until a free key, keeping result keys unique and
  `resultAxisOrder` a valid permutation.
- **Why not the zero-API "re-canonicalize" alternative (Eve Y2):** it would make
  `transpose` unable to expose a permuted `.tensor`, breaking the existing test
  that asserts `transposed.tensor.shape` reflects the permutation — a worse
  public-API change than an additive optional param + field.
- Public surface: one new runtime export (`AxisOrderError`) + an additive
  optional ctor param / readonly field / method on the already-`@public`
  `LabeledTensor` (no other export-name change). MathTS einsum free-axis order is
  assumed `spec.free`-ordered (as the current code already requires) and verified
  only in the gated optional-dep suite. Full suite **2605 passing** (+10); tsc
  src + tests, build, smoke clean.

### Decided — G-9 increment 3: default-pipeline migration DECLINED; fixtures consolidated

The queued "route the DEFAULT GR pipeline onto geometrized units + subsume the
`unitless*` fixtures" was re-examined and split (disposition + Adam challenge-vet:
`docs/planning/v0.14-G9-Increment3-Disposition.md`).

- **Default-pipeline migration — DECLINED (evidence-based).** Its premise (c=G=1
  improves FD precision) is refuted: per-component relative FD error is provably
  unit-invariant (the FD step is coordinate-keyed, identical in both charts), and
  it is MEASURED no-better — Adam reproduced the geometrized Kretschmann
  apples-to-apples and the far-field error DIVERGES with r (relErr 0.40 at
  r=1000·r_s vs SI's ~3.8e-8), an intrinsic signal-to-baseline catastrophe. The
  dynamical consumers (GL4, perihelion, BE-37 eikonal) use analytic closures, not
  FD, and `E=−p_t≈9e16` is conserved bit-exact (cyclic-coordinate momentum the
  symplectic update never touches), so there is no long-integration benefit
  either. The pipeline is already convention-agnostic (one internal pipeline +
  boundary adapters), so there is no dual-path maintenance cost to remove.
  Re-deriving the whole GR pipeline's unit convention for a measured-absent (and
  far-field-negative) precision win is a strictly losing trade. The SI pipeline
  stays the default; the geometrized layer remains the optional boundary API from
  increment 2.
- **Fixture-name consolidation — DONE.** Hard-renamed every `unitless*` (c=1)
  closure to the `geometrized*` convention name so the test suite carries exactly
  two conventions (SI + geometrized) with consistent naming: the shared
  `geometrizedMinkowski{,GInverse}Fn` (`tests/fixtures/minkowski.ts`) + its one
  importer, and the test-local `geometrizedDeSitter*` / `geometrizedSchwarzschild*`
  closures in `bianchi-residual.test.ts` (Adam YELLOW: these carried the same
  `unitless` name and would otherwise leave the rename half-done). Byte-identical
  bodies; test-only (not shipped); no `src/` behavior change, no public-surface
  change. (The unrelated "Unitless" = dimensionless usages, e.g. BE-32 overlap
  parts, are a different meaning and untouched.)

### Added — G-9 increment 2 (geometrized boundary, additive core)

The additive, vettable core of the geometrized-units increment 2 (design:
`docs/planning/v0.14-G9-Increment2-Design.md`, Adam YELLOW + Eve YELLOW, all
findings folded). Builds on increment-1's `geometrized.ts` adapters.

- **Public geometrized adapters.** `toGeometrized` / `fromGeometrized` /
  `geometrizedFactor` / `NonGeometrizableDimensionError` re-tagged `@internal` →
  `@public` and exported from `src/index.ts` — the boundary API for running the
  GR pipeline in geometrized (G = c = 1) units. Four new runtime exports
  (`EXPECTED_RUNTIME_EXPORTS` + snapshot + the `@public`-tag invariant all
  satisfied).
- **Geometrized-native Schwarzschild fixture** (`tests/fixtures/schwarzschild-geometrized.ts`):
  the x⁰ = ct chart (all g_μν dimensionless), mass as a geometrized length
  `M_geom = G·M/c²`, shipping `gFn` + `gInverseFn` (the Kretschmann path's
  inputs). Honestly a DISTINCT chart from the SI x⁰ = t fixture (which carries an
  explicit c² in g_tt), not a unit-rescale of it.
- **SI ↔ geometrized equivalence test** exercising the adapter where it has teeth
  — the MASS input (`M_geom = toGeometrized(M_sun, MASS) = G·M_sun/c² ≈ 1477 m`,
  factor `G/c²`), NOT the K output (K is L⁻⁴ ⟹ factor 1, a no-op). The
  geometrized fixture validates against its own closed form `K = 48 M_geom²/r⁶`
  through the full FD pipeline, matches the SI fixture's K at matched (r, θ), and
  the two closed forms coincide exactly (`48 G²M²/(c⁴r⁶) = 48 M_geom²/r⁶`).
- **Scope honesty.** The FD order-2 claw-back deliverable was CUT (Eve): per-
  component relative FD error is provably unit-invariant, so it tests nothing
  about geometrization and is already covered by `pderiv-order*.test.ts`.
  STRICTLY ADDITIVE — the SI pipeline default is untouched. Increment 3 (deferred,
  own plan+vet): subsuming the `unitless*` fixture family + routing the DEFAULT
  GR pipeline onto the geometrized fast path. Full suite **2595 passing** (+11);
  tsc src + tests clean; build + smoke green.

### Deferred / won't-do (honest dispositions, this cycle)

- **`mergeAxes` / `splitAxis` (rank-changing reshape) — DEFERRED, blocked.** The
  Adam vet (RED, `docs/planning/v0.14-MergeAxes-SplitAxis-Design.md`) found the
  feature would sit on a pre-existing `LabeledTensor` latent: `canonicalLabelOrder`
  (sorted keys) is assumed to track engine axis order, but `transpose`
  (`labeled-tensor.ts:297`) returns labels unchanged after permuting engine axes,
  desyncing them (and `contract`'s result labels aren't sorted either). The
  helpers can't correctly map label keys to engine axes without first fixing that
  invariant — a foundation change to `LabeledTensor`'s internal model with its own
  blast radius. Not shipped; the design note records the spec to resume from.
- **C2 / C3 calibration targets — NOT engineering (physics-blocked).** C2
  (Einstein-Cartan Newtonian limit) needs weak-field-limit machinery that does
  not exist AND a physicist's derivation (BE-17 encodes a torsion-norm scalar
  containing none of the quantities a Newtonian limit relates). C3 (Higgs→Λ
  residue) has no closed-form relation or literature anchor in the repo — the
  edges share no quantity and the cosmological-constant "residue" is the famous
  unsolved problem, not a derivation. Implementing either would require
  fabricating physics; both stay on the human-physicist surface.
- **Kretschmann O(4⁸) symmetry optimization (P-6) — SUPERSEDED (won't-do).** The
  factored-raising optimization already shipped (O-4, ~70×/29.8×), the pipeline is
  now FD-dominated, and the symmetry-pair reduction was explicitly rejected for
  correctness — it is NOT identical to the full sum for the FD-built Riemann
  tensors (small antisymmetry violations), per the rationale in `kretschmann.ts`.
- **Regime-builtins taxonomy — physicist surface (research task).** Source
  comments + todo flag it "per P5 Decision #1, research task not engineering / a
  per-bridge physics review." The mechanism (`defineRegime`) is shipped; the
  taxonomy DECISION (which physics regimes to add) is a physicist's call.

### Internal — unused-export cull (hygiene)

Dropped the vestigial `export` keyword on seven symbols that the dependency-graph
analysis flagged as exported-but-never-imported and that are used only within
their own module: `FormulaDimensionError` / `FormulaDimensionResult`
(`formula-dimension.ts`), `FormulaParserKind` (`formula-registry.ts`),
`LowerNodeRecur` (`derivative-lowering.ts`, `@internal`), `FieldSpec`
(`_be-helpers.ts`, `@internal`), `BridgeCoverage` / `CoverageReport`
(`confrontation-coverage.ts`). Each verified to have zero importers across
`src/`/`tests/`/`bench/`/`examples/`/`bin/` and to be absent from the public
manifest and the `@public`-tag guard lists before de-export. Potentially-unused
exports 39 → 32. No behavior change; tsc src + tests clean, full suite unchanged.
(The `src/composition/*` result/option types the analysis also flags are
deliberate API surface for the in-progress symbolic-composition tranche and were
left exported.)

### Added — `BridgeEquations` convenience facade (v0.14)

A root-level `BridgeEquations` object (`src/bridges/bridge-equations.ts`, re-exported
from `src/index.ts`) gathers every per-bridge `evaluate*()` function under readable
method names — e.g. `BridgeEquations.decoherenceRate({...})` (BE-11),
`BridgeEquations.hawkingTemperature({ M_kg })` (BE-42). Closes the README's
long-standing "computable bridge solvers not yet implemented" note.

- **1:1 pass-through, zero new physics.** Each method is a re-export of the
  existing pure evaluator; TypeScript infers the per-method input/return types
  structurally, so no new named input-type exports hit the public surface — the
  facade adds exactly ONE runtime export. 48 methods across BE-11–54 (some
  bridges expose two evaluators) plus the two v0.4.0 GR evaluators.
- **Honest scope:** BE-25 maps to the live IIT `intrinsicInformation` (the
  archived Penrose-Hameroff `evaluateOrchOR` is deliberately NOT surfaced);
  `onsagerEntropyProduction` (BE-28) carries its module's ⚠ CRITICAL WARNING
  (the σ=ΣJX definiendum, not the MEPP principle); BE-51 has no evaluator and is
  intentionally absent (no fabricated physics).
- Corrects the README example note: the facade is a convenience layer over the
  evaluators, not a verbatim Parts I–III spec API (the spec specifies the
  physics + AST encodings, not this TypeScript class).
- Public-surface snapshot + `EXPECTED_RUNTIME_EXPORTS` updated for the single new
  `BridgeEquations` export. Full suite **2584 passing** (+8); tsc src + tests clean.

### Added — distributional / variational grammar primitives (v0.14)

Two new scalar `ExprNode` arms close the standing roadmap item "grammar
extensions for genuinely-deferred primitives", making the Model-A Langevin /
fluctuation-dissipation relation BE-15 documented as un-encodable DIMENSIONALLY
EXPRESSIBLE. Design + Adam (GREEN) + Eve (YELLOW→GREEN) vet:
`docs/planning/v0.14-Distributional-Grammar-Design.md`.

- `{ kind: 'dirac-delta', arg }` → `[δ(x)] = [x]⁻¹` (`power(dim(arg), −1)`),
  since `∫δ(x)dx = 1`. A dimensionless arg gives a dimensionless δ; the 3-D
  `δ³(x)` is an `op '*'` of three single-arg nodes (→ `L⁻³`).
- `{ kind: 'variational-derivative', functional, field, over }` →
  `[δF/δφ] = [F]/([φ]·[μ])` (`divide(divide([F],[φ]),[μ])`), since
  `δF = ∫(δF/δφ)δφ dμ`. `over` carries the measure dimension `[dμ]` — the dual
  of `integral`, which MULTIPLIES by `[over]`.
- Both arms are SCALAR (a tensor-valued child is rejected with
  `TensorInScalarOpError`, contributing no free indices) and NON-numerical
  (`lowering` throws `NumericalBackendError`, alongside `integral`/`derivative`).
  Inline union members like `integral`/`derivative` ⟹ **zero public-surface
  change** (no `ALL_TYPE_EXPORTS`/runtime-snapshot delta).
- Demonstration (uncontested physics): the full Model-A FDT relation
  `⟨ζζ⟩ = 2Γk_BT δ³(x)δ(t)` and the Langevin `∂φ/∂t = −Γ δH/δφ` both validate
  homogeneous through the new grammar; a deliberately non-homogeneous variant
  (drop one `δ(t)`) is correctly rejected. BE-15's docstring records barriers 1
  (Dirac-δ correlators) and 2 (functional derivative) now LIFTED, with the
  bare-Langevin Γ (`[φ]²L³T⁻¹E⁻¹`) disambiguated from the docstring's existing
  coarsening Γ (`L²/T`). The CATALOG re-encoding that would USE the grammar —
  BE-15's faithful Langevin form, BE-28's faithful MEPP maximization (its σ=ΣJX
  carries a CRITICAL WARNING it is the definiendum, not the principle) — is a
  physics-curation decision deferred to a physicist; barrier 3 (functional
  integration over field configurations) remains out of scope.
- Node-kind count 21 → 23. No new src files (edits only); full suite **2566
  passing** (+16). `tsc --noEmit` clean (src + tests).
- **Catalog applicability verified** (`tests/bridges/catalog-grammar-applicability.test.ts`,
  +10). A survey of all 44 bridges + the known-laws catalog found three entries
  whose canonical forms involve the new constructs; the grammar is pointed at
  each, using only docstring-stated/derivable dimensions: **BE-15** (Model A
  Langevin + FDT) is FULLY expressible (both primitives, homogeneous); **BE-46**
  (Weinberg-Vilenkin anthropic measure) — the observable-fixing `δ(O−O[g,φ])` is
  expressible (`[O]⁻¹`), but the functional metric-integral stays barrier-3
  (out of scope); **BE-28** (MEPP/Onsager) — the variational-δ is expressible on
  the entropy-production functional `∫σ dt` (`σ=[W/K]` stated, → dimensionless),
  but the Lagrange-multiplier + discrete-index-sum remain beyond the two
  primitives (the docstring's ⚠ CRITICAL WARNING holds). Regression: the three
  bridges' currently-encoded RHS still validate and use NEITHER new kind —
  catalog re-encoding stays correctly deferred to a physicist. Full suite
  **2576 passing**.

### Added — geometrized-units boundary adapters (G-9 increment 1, v0.13)

The first, self-contained increment of the long-queued G-9 units-normalization
layer (design: `docs/planning/v0.10.0-Units-Normalization-Design-Note.md`,
Adam-vetted r2; plan: `docs/planning/v0.13-G9-Adapters-Plan.md`, Eve-vetted).

- `src/numerical/geometrized.ts` (internal): `toGeometrized`/`fromGeometrized`/
  `geometrizedFactor` convert a scalar between SI and geometrized (G = c = 1)
  units, driven MECHANICALLY by the `Dimension` exponent vector — the factor is
  `G^M·c^(T−2M)` (each kg → G/c² metres, each second → c metres), no
  per-quantity hand-table. `NonGeometrizableDimensionError` (extends `UPTError`)
  rejects a nonzero I/Θ/N/J exponent (only c and G are in scope).
- Eve caught that the design's M_sun pin literal (1476.6 m) was IAU-nominal and
  disagrees with the repo's `M_SUN_SI`; the test pins against the computed
  `G_SI·M_SUN_SI/C_SI² = 1477.06 m`. Pins (Eve-verified): 1 s → c (exact), c →
  geometrized-1 (exact), length-identity, mass-energy self-consistency, the
  round-trip property (≤1 ulp), and the domain guard. 9 tests.
- ADDITIVE, zero blast radius. Increment 2 (deferred, its own plan+vet):
  geometrized fixtures + subsuming the ad-hoc `unitless` c=1 family, routing the
  GR pipeline onto the geometrized fast path, and the FD order-2 claw-back. No
  public-surface change. src 156→157; full suite 2550 passing (+9).

### Changed — symbolic exponents on a dimensionless base (v0.13)

A bounded core-grammar extension to the `^` `ExprNode` arm: a NON-literal
(input-dependent) exponent is now accepted **when the base is dimensionless** —
sound because `dimensionless^(dimensionless) = dimensionless`, so the result
dimension is statically inferable without the exponent's value. Literal
exponents (any base, e.g. `c^3`) are unchanged; a dimensionful base with a
non-literal exponent still violates (the pinned shape). Design + Adam+Eve
adversarial vet in `docs/planning/v0.13-Symbolic-Exponent-Design.md` (both
YELLOW; all r2/r3 revisions folded in — the tensor-exponent throw, the
null short-circuit, and the existing-edge authoring were the load-bearing
catches; claims grep-verified).

- `validator.ts` `^` arm: literal → `power(baseDim, n)` (unchanged); non-literal
  + dimensionless base → require the exponent dimensionless (+ tensor-exponent
  throw + null short-circuit) → `DIMENSIONLESS`; non-literal + dimensionful base
  → violation. `evalExpr` `^` relaxed to `finite(Math.pow(evalExpr(base),
  evalExpr(exp)), node)` (literal behavior byte-identical).
- **Consumer:** BE-33 (Hertz-Millis) previously *pinned z=1* to use a literal
  `^(-1)` ("the AST `^` op requires a literal-numeric exponent"). `be33Edge`
  now carries the FAITHFUL `symbolic` form `ξ_0·(T/T_0)^(−1/z)` (exponent
  `−1/z`, z an input), dim-validated to `[length]` and drift-guarded against
  `evaluateHertzMillis` with z = 2. The catalog AST `BE33_HERTZ_MILLIS_RHS` is
  unchanged (round-trip preserved). `simplify` gracefully no-ops on variable
  exponents. 9 tests; full suite 2541 passing (+9, no regressions).
- This is valuable independently (faithful scaling-law encodings) but does NOT
  make CI-1 checkable — CI-1 is an over-determination, not a composition.

### Added — orphan-connector analysis (v0.12)

Uses the v0.12 feature map (`upt discover`/`predict`/`coverage`/`symbolic`) to
analyze the catalog's **isolated bridges** and propose / reject candidate
identifications — the catalog's structural frontier (20 of 41 edges are
isolated).

- **`proposeOrphanConnectors`** (`src/composition/bridge-analysis.ts`, internal;
  `upt connectors`): intersects the cross-cluster same-dimension candidates with
  the linkage map's isolated/anchored partition — a *connector* joins an
  isolated (orphan) bridge to the anchored core. Of the 20 orphans, **7 carry a
  same-kind connector; 12 are dimensionally unconnectable**. 6 tests.
- **Finding** (`docs/research/Orphan-Connector-Analysis.md`; spec Part-IX §9
  note): the structural view independently re-derives **CI-1/CI-2** (BE-15
  Model-A coarsening → BE-33/34 criticality) as the only motivated connectors,
  and physics-review **rejects every other** with grounded reasoning (BE-22
  TEE is gapped — no correlation length; a Förster radius is not a horizon; a
  proton tunneling mass is not a strange-metal carrier; the `hubble-rate ≡
  decoherence-rate` decoy). A quantified negative: the orphan frontier is
  decoy-dominated, and the catalog's real growth edge is the **12 unconnectable
  orphans** (need NEW bridges, not re-labeling). Also documents that a "rich"
  multi-quantity discovery anchor turns all 132 candidates contradictory (the
  consistency check needs a physically-consistent seed — the numeric channel is
  anchor-limited by design). Nothing registered in `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS`.
- **Correction (CI-1 is over-determination, not composition).** A follow-on
  investigation of "test CI-1 by symbolic derivation" found the framing wrong:
  `coarsening-length` and `quantum-correlation-length` are only ever *targets*
  (never sources), so identifying them merges two independent derivations
  (Model-A dynamics vs Hertz-Millis statics) — not a chain — and
  `composeSymbolic` does not apply. Confirmation is a physicist's
  dynamic-scaling judgment, not more tooling. BE-33/34 are additionally
  grammar-blocked (their powers are the critical exponents ν/z themselves; the
  `^` arm admits only literal exponents). Documented in the research note +
  Part-IX §9; a bounded "symbolic exponent on a dimensionless base" grammar
  extension is noted as a possible future foundation cycle.

### Added — premise-extension directions (v0.12)

Four extensions that advance the original premise — *use the tensor concept
to MAP physics and DERIVE bridges/connections* — by wiring the existing
verification primitives into generative tools and closing one
author-flagged gap. Design: `docs/planning/v0.12.0-Premise-Extensions-Design.md`.
The three new analysis layers are INTERNAL (off `src/index.ts`, like
`bridge-analysis.ts`) and reached by the CLI via `dist/` subpaths; each is a
REVIEW SURFACE for physicist judgment, never automated discovery.

- **Direction 3 — equation-level valence homogeneity** (`validateEquation`,
  `src/dimensional/validator.ts`). The validator already tracked tensor
  `freeIndices` but `validateEquation` *deferred* comparing the two sides of
  an equation (the "Task 7" TODO). It now checks that LHS and RHS share the
  same free-index signature, so a rank-2 tensor equated to a scalar is
  rejected even when the SI dimensions match — the spec's "Bridge Eq 17"
  index-rank mismatch the header said it couldn't catch. Scalar (typed-stub)
  equations are unaffected; full suite unchanged. 5 tests.
- **Direction 1 — the namesake made operational** (`bridge-prediction.ts`,
  internal; `upt predict`). Projects `CATALOG_GRAPH` onto the (scale × force)
  regime plane, populates a real `UniversalTensor` from it (the catalog's
  structure finally carried by the namesake), and ranks the EMPTY regime
  cells between well-connected regimes as undiscovered-link hypotheses
  (triadic closure). Real graph: 40/41 edges placed onto 15 regimes. 8 tests.
- **Direction 2 — the discovery loop** (`discovery.ts`, internal;
  `upt discover`). Vets each `proposeLinkCandidates` output by hypothesizing
  the identification `a≡b` and testing it with the existing primitives:
  does it merge two graph components (`linkageMap`/union-find), unlock
  quantities from an anchor (`forwardClosure`), and stay numerically
  consistent (`retrodict` — the strong filter)? Ranks
  `promising`/`inert`/`contradictory`. Real funnel: 132 candidates →
  26 promising · 106 inert · 0 contradictory. 6 tests.
- **Direction 4 — empirical-spine coverage audit**
  (`confrontation-coverage.ts`, internal; `upt coverage`). Audits each
  catalogued bridge's grounding tier — `data-confronted` /
  `graph-computable` / `encoded-only` / `thin` — reading the catalog, graph,
  and confrontation modules; **fabricates nothing**. Targets the
  CONTRIBUTING.md physicist review. Real catalog: 2 data-confronted, 36
  graph-computable, 6 encoded-only, 0 thin. 5 tests.

CLI gains `upt predict`, `upt discover`, `upt coverage`.

### Added — symbolic bridge composition (the Observable contract, v0.12)

Pushes composition from NUMERIC-only (`composeEdges` chains `evaluate`
closures) to SYMBOLIC: composing two bridges produces a new `ExprNode` that is
dimensionally validated and numerically evaluable. Resolves the Part-IX §4
Observable-contract deferral with a fourth option the spec did not enumerate —
an OPTIONAL `symbolic` ExprNode on a bridge edge, composed by AST substitution
(non-breaking; no per-pair adapters; retains dimensional type-safety). Design +
Adam+Eve adversarial vet in
`docs/planning/v0.12.0-Symbolic-Composition-Design.md` (both YELLOW; all 13
r2/r3 revisions folded in, Eve's claims grep-verified).

- **`composeSymbolic(first, second)`** (`@public`) substitutes `first`'s
  `symbolic` form into the junction leaf of `second`'s and returns an
  **`Observable`** — `{ name, symbol, dim, expr, leaves, evaluate }`, the
  shared return contract the spec said was missing. The composed AST is
  dimensionally validated (`equals` against `second.target.dim`); a
  zero-occurrence junction throws (silent-no-op guard, Adam A-3); strict
  `evaluate` input (Eve EVE-1); pure symbolic value, not domain-checked
  (use `composeEdges` for domain-checked numeric values).
- **`symbolic?: ExprNode`** — an optional, additive field on `BridgeEdge`
  whose leaves are source-quantity NAMES + a constant registry. Authored for
  the CT-1/CT-1b chain edges (`be42Edge`, `be16Edge`, `be42ViaRsEdge`,
  `lawSchwarzschildRadius`). A drift-guard test binds each symbolic form to its
  numeric evaluator at relative tolerance (Adam A-2).
- Internal primitives (`@internal`): `evalExpr` (the missing scalar-`ExprNode`
  value evaluator), `substitute` (returns `{expr, count}`), and the `CONSTANTS`
  registry (single-sourced from `core/constants.js`).
- Marquee: `composeSymbolic(be42Edge, be16Edge)` yields the CT-1 energy
  `E_min = k_B·(ℏc³/8πG·mass·k_B)·ln2` (validated `[energy]`); CT-1b recovers
  the solar-mass Hawking temperature `6.17e-8 K` symbolically — both matching
  the numeric `composeEdges` pipeline to float precision. CLI: `upt symbolic`.
  19 tests.

### Added — optional MathTS-backed simplification (v0.12)

The symbolic-composition feature shipped with UNSIMPLIFIED composed ASTs
(CT-1's `k_B` uncancelled). This supplement folds them via
`@danielsimonjr/mathts-functions`' `simplify` (the same optional peer the
Path-A formula parser loads), behind the established Path-A/Path-B contract —
absent peer degrades to a no-op. Design + Adam+Eve adversarial vet in
`docs/planning/v0.12.0-Symbolic-Simplification-Design.md` (both YELLOW; all 11
r2/r3 revisions folded in, claims grep-verified, the round-trip + node API
runtime-verified). Full MathTS perspective: `mathts-expression`/`-functions`
are a mathjs-lineage CAS (`parse`/`simplify`/`derivative`); `mathts-core` also
ships a units engine + exact arithmetic (`BigNumber`/`Fraction`) — noted but
out of scope (UPT's ℤ⁷ `Dimension` is bespoke).

- **`simplifyExpr` / `simplifyObservable`** (`src/composition/expr-simplify.ts`,
  internal; `upt symbolic --simplify`). Gensym-renders a scalar `ExprNode`
  FULLY PARENTHESIZED (no precedence ambiguity — Eve EVE-A), `parse`+`simplify`,
  walks the result back integer-exponent-strict (Adam/Eve HIGH-1). THREE guards
  make the black-box CAS safe: dimensional `equals`, structural subset (no leaf
  invented — Adam HIGH-2), and numeric agreement over ≥2 synthesized probes
  (Adam CRITICAL-2; `<2` finite ⇒ no-op, never vacuous-pass — Eve EVE-C). A
  representable result that disagrees THROWS `SimplificationError`; anything
  unrepresentable/unverifiable/absent degrades gracefully.
- Marquee: `upt symbolic --simplify` reduces CT-1's
  `k_B·(ℏc³/8πG·mass·k_B)·ln2` → `ℏc³·ln2/(8πG·mass)` (k_B cancels), value +
  dimension preserved. CT-1b currently no-ops (a MathTS `simplify` BigInt bug
  on `a/(b/c²)` — caught and degraded, the best-effort contract working). 6
  tests. No public-surface change (internal). `makeObservable` extracted in
  `compose-symbolic.ts` so a simplified Observable gets a fresh strict closure
  (Adam HIGH-3).

### Added

- **`CATALOG_GRAPH`** (`src/composition/catalog-graph.ts`; `@public`,
  re-exported from `src/index.ts`): the 41-edge composition graph (9
  calibration + 6 catalog-tranche + 26 catalog-full) assembled once into a
  single `readonly BridgeEdge[]`. Previously the full edge list was
  hand-rebuilt in ~10 places (every composition test, `bin/upt.mjs`, the
  analysis defaults); those now import the one constant. Part of the lean
  sprint below.
- **Link-candidate proposals** (`proposeLinkCandidates` in
  `src/composition/bridge-analysis.ts`; `upt candidates`;
  `docs/research/Linkage-Candidate-Proposals.md`): uses the linkage map to
  propose candidate cross-cluster identifications — pairs of quantities in
  different clusters sharing a non-dimensionless dimension (the kind of
  link the Hawking-temperature ≡ temperature identification was), tagged
  `touchesCore` / `sameKind`. The result quantifies the false-positive
  rate of dimensional matching one last time: **132 candidates → 98
  core-touching → 36 same-kind**, of which ~34 are still coincidences
  (`decoherence-rate ≟ hubble-rate`) or pairs the catalog deliberately
  keeps distinct (`effective-mass ≠ mass`); **≈3 are genuinely motivated**
  (the critical-dynamics correlation length / timescale, which would link
  the isolated Model-A coarsening bridge to the Kibble–Zurek cluster).
  Explicitly a REVIEW SURFACE for human adjudication (Part-VI §XXVII-B),
  NOT discovered bridges. Internal. 6 tests. The three motivated
  candidates are recorded in the formal spec as **Part-IX §9 (Phase-D
  candidate identifications — PROPOSED, UNADJUDICATED)** — none registered
  in `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS`; promotion needs a physicist's judgment.
- **Catalog linkage map** (`linkageMap` in
  `src/composition/bridge-analysis.ts`; `upt map`;
  `docs/research/Catalog-Linkage-Map.md`): the capstone of the
  bridge-inference toolset — maps how the catalog's equations connect via
  shared quantities (honoring `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS`). Connected
  components reveal a hub-and-spoke structure: **23 components** over the
  41 edges — one dominant **anchored cluster of 16** (GR + thermal/quantum,
  hubbed on `mass`/`temperature`, 5 established edges), a 3-edge
  cosmological-constant cluster, a 2-edge Friedmann cluster, and **20
  isolated** edges; 11 compose into chains. The single Hawking-temperature
  identification is what fuses the gravitational and thermodynamic
  sub-clusters. A structural map, explicitly NOT a credibility signal.
  Internal — not on the public surface. 6 tests.

### Changed

- **Lean sprint — simplify / minimize / dedup (no behavior change).** A
  codebase-lean pass after the v0.8–v0.11 buildout (dep-graph deep dive;
  `docs/planning/Lean-Sprint-Plan.md`). The structure was already clean (0
  dead files, 0 cycles), so the wins are deduplication and surface
  trimming, all gated by the full suite (2477 passing, unchanged):
  - **S1** — the 41-edge graph, formerly rebuilt in ~10 places, is now the
    single `CATALOG_GRAPH` constant (see Added); every composition test +
    `bin/upt.mjs` consume it.
  - **S2** — `tests/dimensional/bridge-derivation-audit.test.ts` reused its
    own private copies of `deriveBridge` / `freeParameters` / `subsetsBySize`
    / `makeInputs`; it now imports `attemptDerivation` / `dimensionalFreedom`
    from `bridge-analysis.ts` (the engine those copies duplicated).
  - **S3** — the `D(L,M,T,Θ)` dimension-factory copied across the dimensional
    test files is now the single `tests/fixtures/dimension.ts`.
  - **S4** — `linkageMap` / `proposeLinkCandidates` shared the same
    `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS` canonicalizer + `quantitiesOf`; both are now
    extracted helpers (`anchoringDistance` deliberately keeps its raw-name
    behavior — its distance contract is pinned).
  - **M1 / M2** — un-exported 10 internal-only symbols never imported across
    a module boundary (`createFormulaDimensionChecker`,
    `createMathtsFormulaParser`, `FUNDAMENTAL_CONSTANTS`,
    `DATA_CONFRONTED_BE_IDS`, `NamedConstant`, `numberToCellConfidence`,
    `checkRegimeConsistency`, BE-20's `INV_LENGTH_2`, `bianchiResidualAt`,
    `MetricFnNested`). Flagged-but-retained: `FieldSpec` / `LowerNodeRecur`
    (params of exported functions — un-exporting breaks `.d.ts` emit) and the
    `bridge-analysis` result-type interfaces (return types of exported
    functions). Dep-tool unused-export count: 37 → 27.
- **Formula dimensional check is now default-on (no MathTS peer needed).**
  The check previously required the MathTS AST; the Path B parser's own AST
  is now exposed (`parseFormulaToAst` / `evalFormulaAst`, `@internal`) and a
  second transpiler (`transpilePathB`) feeds the same dimensional core. So
  `getFormulaDimensionChecker()` always returns a checker — MathTS AST when
  the peer is installed, the built-in AST otherwise — both transpiling to
  the same `ExprNode` (a builtin↔mathts parity test pins the agreement).
  `upt derive --formula` reports the dimension/homogeneity regardless of
  whether MathTS is installed.

### Added

- **Formula dimensional check (MathTS Phase 2)** — `upt derive --formula`
  now reports whether a user's formula is dimensionally HOMOGENEOUS and
  what dimension it has, not just the prefactor. New internal module
  `src/numerical/formula-dimension.ts` transpiles the MathTS formula AST
  (Path A) into UPT's own dimensional `ExprNode` and runs `validate()` —
  unifying string→AST (MathTS) with AST→dimension (UPT). Constants→
  dimensionless, variables→declared dim, `sqrt`/`pow`/`^`→power ops
  (constant exponents), `abs`→passthrough, transcendentals via the
  typed-stub pattern (dimensionless argument required). The pendulum
  `2*pi*sqrt(length/gravity)` reports `[time] ✓ matches target`;
  `length + gravity` is reported not homogeneous; `sin(length)` is
  rejected; the Hawking formula infers `[temperature]`. MathTS-only (needs
  the AST) — `getFormulaDimensionChecker()` returns `null` under Path B.
  Design: `docs/planning/Formula-Dimensional-Check-Design-Note.md`. 9
  tests.
- **MathTS-backed formula parser (Path A)** — the `upt` formula commands
  now use `@danielsimonjr/mathts-functions`'s mathjs engine when the
  optional peers are installed, falling back to the self-contained Path B
  parser otherwise. New internal modules: `formula-mathts.ts` (the
  MathTS-backed `FormulaParser`, dynamically loaded via the
  `mathts-functions.ambient.d.ts` optional-peer pattern; scalar-only
  guard; free-variable extraction over the MathTS AST) and
  `formula-registry.ts` (`getFormulaParser`/`getFormulaParserKind` — picks
  MathTS when it smoke-tests clean, else Path B; suppresses MathTS's
  WASM-fallback chatter). The two parsers are proven interchangeable by a
  shared conformance suite (`formula-conformance.ts`) run against both
  (`*.builtin.test.ts` / `*.mathts.test.ts`); their one accepted
  divergence is `e` (MathTS = Euler's number, Path B = a free variable).
  The CLI consumes the registry; `--debug` prints the active parser. The
  upstream blocker is resolved — `mathts-core@0.1.3` exports `Unit`,
  `mathts-functions@0.2.2` ships the assembled engine; the MathTS packages
  stay in `optionalDependencies` (UPT keeps zero hard dependencies, and
  builds/tests green with the peers absent). 47 tests.
- **Custom equations in the CLI (Path B)** — non-TypeScript users can now
  feed their OWN equations:
  - `src/numerical/formula.ts` (internal): a self-contained, dependency-
    free recursive-descent parser/evaluator for closed-form scalar
    expressions behind a `FormulaParser` interface (so a MathTS-backed
    parser — Path A — can be swapped in later). SAFE: no `eval`, only
    arithmetic + a function whitelist + caller-supplied variables; an
    unknown symbol is an error, never an implicit global. 11 tests.
  - `src/dimensional/dimension-spec.ts` (internal): parses human dimension
    strings (named dims, constants `hbar`/`c`/`G`/`k_B`/`e` exact-case so
    `G`≠`g`, or explicit `L^3.M^-1.T^-2`) into `Dimension`s. 6 tests.
  - CLI: `upt eval "<formula>" name=value …` evaluates a user formula;
    `upt derive <target:dim> <var:dim> … [--formula "<expr>"]` derives a
    user equation's dimensional form and, with `--formula`, verifies it
    and recovers the dimensionless prefactor (e.g. the pendulum
    `2*pi*sqrt(length/gravity)` → period ∝ length^0.5·gravity^-0.5,
    prefactor ≈ 2π). Both internal modules; no public-surface change.
- **Unified `upt` CLI** (`bin/upt.mjs`, wired as a `package.json` `bin`):
  one entry point for non-TypeScript users with three subcommands —
  `upt explain <quantity> [name=value …]`, `upt priority`, `upt audit` —
  plus `help` and a no-arg demo. Installable (`npx universal-physics-tensor
  <cmd>` once published; `bin` added to the `files` whitelist). Consolidates
  and replaces the separate `examples/explain.mjs` and
  `examples/bridge-priority.mjs` scripts; `npm run explain` /
  `npm run bridge-priority` are kept as aliases, and `npm run upt -- <cmd>`
  is added.
- **Bridge-priority scorecard** (`src/composition/bridge-analysis.ts`,
  internal; `examples/bridge-priority.mjs` / `npm run bridge-priority`;
  `docs/research/Bridge-Priority-Scorecard.md`): a structural-triage tool
  ranking the speculative bridges by how DECIDABLE they are against
  established physics — three engine signals (`grounding` via
  `attemptDerivation`, `complexity` via `dimensionalFreedom`, `anchoring`
  via `anchoringDistance` to the established-confidence core) plus a
  catalog-joined data-confrontation flag, partitioned into Tiers 1/2/3
  (8/6/18 of the 32 non-established bridges). **Explicitly a
  review/confrontation-priority ranking, NOT a credibility score** — the
  signals are orthogonal to truth (a highly-speculative bridge sits in
  Tier 1; established physics is "unclosable"), and the module docstring,
  CLI, doc, and tests all carry the caveat. Internal — not added to the
  public surface. 11 tests.
- **Dimensional-complexity spectrum + orthogonality finding** (extends
  the bridge audit): grades each non-derived bridge by its number of free
  dimensionless parameters (minimal-span constant subset, then leftover
  π-groups − 1) — turning the flat "25 unclosable" into a spectrum (0→6).
  11 of them are exactly one dimensionless ratio from a monomial,
  **including the established Mercury perihelion (be-52) and Shapiro
  delay (be-37)**. Cross-tabulated against catalog `status`, the audit
  buckets are shown to be ORTHOGONAL to credibility (the unclosable
  bucket holds 5 established bridges; the derived bucket is 8/11
  speculative) — the doc now carries an explicit "not a credibility
  score; do not prune/rank by it" caveat. 5 added tests.
- **Bridge-equation dimensional audit**
  (`tests/dimensional/bridge-derivation-audit.test.ts` +
  `docs/research/Bridge-Equation-Dimensional-Audit.md`): points the
  Buckingham-π engine at all 41 catalog bridge edges and classifies each
  by attempting to derive it — find a fundamental-constant subset that
  dimensionally closes the target, then verify the monomial against the
  bridge's own evaluator (constant ratio = match). Result: **11 derived,
  5 decoy-only, 25 unclosable.** For the derived ones, the numerical
  match recovers the dimensionless prefactor the engine cannot supply —
  ln 2 (Landauer), 1/4π (KSS bound and Hawking-via-r_s), 1/8π (vacuum
  energy ρ_Λ = Λc²/8πG), 2 (Schwarzschild), √(2π) (thermal de Broglie),
  4 (R = 4Λ). The decoy cases (e.g. be-42 direct → the rest-mass
  temperature Mc²/k_B, not the Hawking temperature ∝ 1/M; be-27 →
  additive, not a monomial) are the vivid confirmation that dimensional
  matching is a form filter, not a discovery engine. 10 tests.
- **Dimensional-derivation benchmark**
  (`tests/dimensional/derivation-benchmark.test.ts` +
  `docs/research/Dimensional-Derivation-Benchmark.md`): nine known
  physics equations re-derived by the Buckingham-π engine — pendulum
  period, Kepler's third law, Schwarzschild radius, string-wave speed,
  the Planck length/mass/time, the Compton wavelength, and the thermal de
  Broglie wavelength (BE-12) — plus the Reynolds number as a dimensionless
  group. Each asserts the engine recovers the textbook monomial (rational
  exponents exact); the research doc records the verbatim engine output.
  Guards that the engine keeps reproducing classical dimensional analysis
  — and, in the negative cases, keeps refusing to invent missing
  constants (Schwarzschild from `{mass}` alone → not determined). 11
  tests.

- **`explainQuantity` — unified bridge-inference entry point**
  (`src/composition/explain.ts`): synthesizes the three primitives into
  one `QuantityExplanation`. Given a target and a known set (names, or
  `name → value`), it runs the identifiability classifier (how the graph
  computes the target), the retrodiction harness (whether the redundant
  derivations agree + the recovered value, when values are supplied), and
  the Buckingham-π layer (`dimensionallyDetermines` — whether the known
  set is dimensionally sufficient, independent of the graph), and emits a
  plain-language `summary`. The three answer complementary questions: for
  `hawking-temperature` from `{mass: M_sun}` the summary reports
  over-determined (be-42, be-42-via-rs), derivations agree, value
  ≈ 6.17×10⁻⁸ K, AND that mass alone is not dimensionally sufficient (the
  evaluator carries ℏ, c, G, k_B). `extraDimensions` lets the dimensional
  layer test a known set richer than the graph's nodes. Completes the
  bridge-inference suite: all three primitives plus the unifying entry
  point. (Surface 163→164; snapshot updated.)
  - **Full-chain (leaf-to-target) derivations:** each
    `DerivationExplanation` now carries `leafInputs` (the immediate
    last-hop `sources` traced back through every intermediate to the leaf
    inputs) and an optional `dimensionalForm` (the target as a monomial
    in those leaves, when they dimensionally fix it). E.g. be-42-via-rs's
    last-hop source is `schwarzschild-radius` but its leaf input is
    `mass`.
  - **CLI example** (`examples/explain.mjs`, `npm run explain`): surfaces
    the one-line `summary` for non-TypeScript users —
    `node examples/explain.mjs hawking-temperature mass=1.989e30`.

- **Identifiability classifier** (`src/composition/identifiability.ts` —
  `classifyIdentifiability`, `classifyAll`, `forwardClosure`): a
  STRUCTURAL classifier over the directed composition hypergraph. Given a
  known-quantity set and a target, it counts independent derivations and
  returns the epistemics-note trichotomy — `under-determined` (decline),
  `exactly-determined` (solve), `over-determined` (the surplus
  derivations are falsifiable consistency constraints), plus `given`.
  Honors `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS` in the forward closure (mirroring
  `composeEdges`); excludes circular self-support via a target-removed
  closure; reports a `blockingFrontier` of upstream gaps for
  under-determined targets. Real-graph anchor: from `{mass}`,
  `hawking-temperature` is over-determined (be-42 and be-42-via-rs both
  fire — schwarzschild-radius is itself derivable from mass), and
  `landauer-erasure-energy` is determinable ONLY with the registered
  hawking-temperature ≡ temperature identification. Structural, not
  parametric (documented limitation). 15 tests; 3 runtime exports added
  to the public surface (snapshot updated).
- **Retrodiction harness** (`src/composition/retrodiction.ts` —
  `retrodict`, `retrodictNode`): the framework's own falsification
  benchmark and the numerical counterpart of the classifier's
  over-determined verdict. Masks an over-determined node (recomputes
  source values with every edge into it removed), recovers it via each
  independent derivation through the domain-checked `evaluateEdge`, and
  scores the relative spread — `consistent` / `inconsistent` (a
  falsification: two encodings of one quantity disagree) / `single` /
  `unrecoverable`, with a headline `allConsistent` gate. Optional
  external `references` add textbook-value scoring. Pass bar
  PRE-REGISTERED (relative spread ≤ 1e-6) in
  `docs/planning/Retrodiction-Harness-Design-Note.md`. Pre-registered
  first-run anchor (passing): from `{mass: M_sun}`, `hawking-temperature`
  is over-determined and `consistent` — be-42 (T_H = ℏc³/8πGMk_B) and
  be-42-via-rs (T_H = ℏc/4πk_B·r_s, r_s = 2GM/c² from the law edge) agree
  to float precision — and recovers the ≈ 6.17×10⁻⁸ K solar-mass value.
  10 tests; 2 runtime exports (surface 158→160; snapshot updated).
- **Buckingham-π enumerator** (`src/dimensional/buckingham.ts` —
  `buckinghamPi`, `dimensionallyDetermines`, `RationalizationError`): the
  principled primitive for the classifier's exactly-determined case.
  `buckinghamPi` returns the n − r dimensionless groups of a variable set
  (the null space of the dimension matrix, computed in EXACT rational
  arithmetic) with a `dimensionally-independent` / `single-invariant` /
  `multiple-invariants` verdict; `dimensionallyDetermines(target,
  governing)` reports whether the target is fixed UP TO A DIMENSIONLESS
  CONSTANT and returns the (possibly rational) monomial. The result types
  carry FORM only — no value or constant field anywhere — enforcing the
  honest boundary between dimensional analysis and numerology. Pins the
  canonical results: pendulum T = const·√(L/g), Schwarzschild
  r_s = const·GM/c², and that mass alone does NOT determine r_s (G and c
  are required — dimensional analysis correctly exposes the dimensionful
  constants the graph's law edge smuggles in). 11 tests; 3 runtime
  exports (surface 160→163; snapshot updated).
- **Bridge-inference epistemics note** + design notes
  (`docs/planning/Bridge-Inference-Epistemics-Note.md`,
  `Identifiability-Classifier-Design-Note.md`,
  `Retrodiction-Harness-Design-Note.md`): the (A) constraint-propagation
  vs (B) discovery split, the identifiability trichotomy, the
  retrodiction benchmark, and structural-analogy-over-variable-
  similarity. All three build targets are now implemented — the
  classifier (Consequence 1), the retrodiction harness (Consequence 2),
  and the Buckingham-π enumerator.

### Security

- **Removed the `@yao-pkg/pkg` dev-dependency from the three `tools/`
  utilities** (`create-dependency-graph`, `chunking-for-files`,
  `compress-for-context`). It existed only for a `build:exe` script that
  packaged each tool into an unused, never-committed Windows `.exe` — the
  tools are run via `npx tsx`/`node` (and `create-dependency-graph`
  resolves `js-yaml` from the root `node_modules`), so the `.exe` path was
  dead. The dependency transitively pulled **esbuild 0.27.7**, vulnerable to
  GHSA-gv7w-rqvm-qjhr (NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY RCE, **high**) and
  GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr (Windows dev-server arbitrary file read, **low**) —
  the two Dependabot alerts on the default branch. Every `@yao-pkg/pkg`
  release (through the current 6.20.0) still pins `esbuild@^0.27.3`, all of
  which fall in the vulnerable `0.17.0–0.28.0` range (patched only in
  0.28.1), so there was no upgrade path; removing the dead build path is the
  fix. Also deleted the inconsistently-committed
  `tools/create-dependency-graph/package-lock.json` (its two sibling tools
  never committed one — it was the sole manifest Dependabot could scan). The
  `tools/` manifests now carry only `js-yaml` + `typescript` + `@types/*`,
  matching the documented "minimal / zero deps" intent in `tools/README.md`.

### Changed — dependency refresh

- **Within-range dependency refresh** (`npm update`, root lockfile only — no
  `package.json` range changes): `@danielsimonjr/mathts-expression`
  0.2.1→0.2.2, `@danielsimonjr/mathts-functions` 0.2.2→0.2.3, `@types/node`
  25.9.1→25.9.3, `vitest` 4.1.7→4.1.8 (plus their transitives; 21 packages,
  no net-new). Dep-health snapshot at this HEAD: **`npm audit` = 0
  vulnerabilities**, **`npm outdated` = clean**. Full suite (2477 passing),
  both `tsc` gates, build, and smoke re-verified green on the new pins.

---

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-11 (UNRELEASED — open-items sprint; single final tag still recommended)

Team execution of the todo's open code items (3 waves, 6 agents + direct).

### Added

- **Namespacing gate (Option D, per the Adam-vetted r2):**
  `CompositionAliasError` name-collision rule; `SOURCE_ALIAS_DISPOSITIONS`
  reviewable registry (+ `aliases` option, `renameSecond` with the
  vet-mandated input remap); centralized `quantities.ts` (131 nodes,
  ONE object per canonical name, uniqueness-pinned); `M_E_SI`; all six
  acceptance criteria pass incl. the λ_T(m_e, T_H) = 3.0012×10⁻⁴ m pins.
- **Full catalog→graph migration: 15 → 41 edges** (+26 in
  catalog-full.ts; 5 NOT-A-BRIDGE entries skipped per the negative
  catalog; BE-44 honestly skipped — array-input evaluator). Naming
  judgments recorded (`effective-mass`, `tunneling-mass` ≠ `mass`).
  Phase-D over the full 41-edge graph: 11 compositions, **7 novel candidates**
  (docs/research/v0.11.0-novel-candidates.md), 1 collision correctly
  held at the gate.
- **O-4 + Kretschmann optimization:** computeKretschmann/WeylInputs
  widened (non-breaking); shims removed; sibling fixtures unified to
  Float64Array; exact factored index-raising (4×4⁵, no symmetry
  assumption) → **29.8× compute speedup** (pins < 1e-15 incl. random
  non-symmetric input).
- **Klein-Gordon dispersion evaluator** (plane-wave sector;
  `evaluateKGDispersionResidual` + `verifyKleinGordonPlaneWave`; 18
  tests; Part-X updated honestly).
- **BE-23 Planckian data confrontation** (`confrontBE23` ± uncertainty)
  vs Legros et al. 2019 — HONEST AGGREGATE encoding (per-material table
  not fabricated when unverifiable; machine-readable honesty marker).
- **G-9 note Adam-vetted** (YELLOW; r2 applied — corrected conversion
  formula, x⁰=ct, FD unit-invariance finding reframes criterion (b);
  implementation queued v0.12).

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-11 (UNRELEASED — recommended single tag at final HEAD, rolling up 0.8.0/0.9.0)

Part-IX Phase C/D closure + uncertainty propagation + graph growth.
Plan: `docs/planning/v0.10.0-Improvement-Plan.md` (pre-registrations
committed before implementations, per the P-3 discipline).

### Added

- **Phase C stress tests (Part-IX §6 bar MET):** ST-1 — the dimension
  functor refuses λ_T→temperature even under a forced human
  identification; ST-2 — photon grazing AT r_s composes type-validly
  and fails at the weak-field DOMAIN with correct attribution.
- **Phase D enumerator (≥1 novel candidate bar MET):**
  `enumerateCompositions` over the 15-edge graph → 6 valid
  compositions, 4 registered (completeness check), **2 novel** —
  review surface at `docs/research/v0.10.0-novel-candidates.md`.
  Mechanically surfaced finding: same-named quantities ALIAS across
  composed operands (`be-42>>be-12` feeds one 'mass' to both
  black-hole and particle slots) — per-edge namespacing is the v0.11
  design question; the clean candidate `be-42-via-rs>>be-12`
  (λ_T at T_H(r_s)) is the first machine-proposed relation awaiting
  physicist review.
- **Uncertainty propagation (the G-3 claim, delivered):**
  `propagateUncertainty` (first-order, central-difference Jacobian) —
  works on composed edges for free (D-2 closure);
  `confrontBE36WithUncertainty` propagates Δt = 1.74±0.05 s →
  σ ≈ 1.9e-17 on the positive bound (not uncertainty-fragile at ±3σ).
- **Graph tranche (9 → 15 edges):** be14/19/21/48/53/54 wrapping
  existing validated evaluators (value pins + domain tests + catalog
  status drift guard; KSS is the first nullary edge).
- **Research note** (`docs/research/v0.10.0-Composition-Research-Note.md`)
  with verified registration-precedes-implementation SHA pairs.
- **CI**: strict whole-repo typecheck gate (`tsc -p tsconfig.tests.json`)
  added to the workflow.

### Changed — post-audit decisions (user, 2026-06-11)

- **Flux Rule 3 (Causality) promoted WARNING → ERROR** (the v0.7
  "deferred to v0.8" decision, finally made): a reverse-arrow
  BridgeCell (coarser→finer scale) now fail-atomics at `addCell`;
  deliberate reverse bridges go through the causality whitelist (design
  review). Live catalog verified clean before promotion (23/23
  submittable cells, zero reverse arrows). 3 test pins updated.
- **Architecture archive**: dated v0.4.x–v0.7.x records (audits,
  baselines, vets, release drafts — 28 files + 2 dirs) moved to
  `docs/architecture/archive/` with a point-in-time README; ~73
  referencing files' paths rewritten. Forcing incident: the same-day
  task audit took two stale claims from these files as current.
- **v0.11 namespacing gate**: design note r1 vetted **RED** by Adam
  (the same-object carve-out was factually wrong — be-42>>be-12 and
  ST-2 are object-identical) → r2 adopts the pure name-collision rule
  + `SOURCE_ALIAS_DISPOSITIONS` + Quantity-node centralization
  prerequisite. The 29-edge migration is gated on r2's six acceptance
  criteria.

### Notes

- Version bumped 0.8.0 → 0.10.0; the 0.8.0/0.9.0 milestones below roll
  into the single v0.10.0 tag (v0.5.1→v0.7.0 precedent). CLAUDE.md +
  todo refreshed.

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-11 (UNRELEASED milestone — Float64Array hygiene sprint)

The renumbered hygiene sprint (planned as "v0.7.2"; renumbered per
v0.8.0 design r2-6). Suite 2186 → **2194 passed** (+11 net new pins
over the v0.8.0 release: R-1b, R-1×2, R-1c, S-9×8, −3 superseded).

### Changed

- **O-6**: `painleveGullstrandGFn`/`GInverseFn` → row-major
  `Float64Array(16)` (BREAKING for subpath importers only; PG is the
  M-2 deferral, not in the root manifest). R-1b off-diagonal
  transpose pin added.
- **O-1**: Schwarzschild fixture `schwarzschildGInverseFn` →
  `Float64Array(16)`, `schwarzschildDgInverseFn` → `Float64Array(64)`
  (`flat[λ*16+μ*4+ν]`, Decision #1 layout); hot-path consumers
  rewritten with dim-stride indexing (gl4-integrator Picard loops,
  perihelion-finder, null-ic, be37-covariant-eikonal local builders);
  17 test/bench files migrated (flat reads, unflatten shims at the
  number[][] O-4 boundaries, flat test builders). R-1/R-1c pins added.
  Scope corrections: killing.ts NOT migrated (lower-metric providers,
  outside O-1); computeWeylTensor/computeKretschmann stay nested (O-4
  deferred). Sibling fixtures stay nested (Decision #8).
- **S-9**: the 5 deferred-evaluator arms in `lowerNode` collapsed into
  `DEFERRED_EVALUATOR_REGISTRY` + registry-consulting default arm, with
  compile-time exhaustiveness (`Exclude<…> → never`) + 8 runtime pins.
- **Bench gate (Decision #6, same-machine ratios)**: PO-1 solveGL4Stage
  **1.56× single / 1.62× batch** → SHIP-WITH-NOTE (1.5–2× band).

### Added

- `MetricFnFlat` / `MetricFnNested` aliases; `NestedArray` admits
  `Float64Array` (runtime-safe: `flattenNA` iterates leaves).
- `tsconfig.tests.json` whole-repo typecheck **diff-gate** (first run
  baselined 71 preexisting legacy errors —
  `docs/architecture/v0.9.0-tsc-tests-baseline.txt`; gate = no NEW
  errors). Known blind spot recorded: `as unknown as` casts (two such
  files broke at runtime only and were fixed).
- Phase docs: `v0.9.0-baseline.md`, `v0.9.0-phase-1-vet.md` (mid-cycle
  vet YELLOW; H-1 silent-NaN PG bench fixed pre-Phase-3).

### Added — CT-3 (Part-IX C1 realized)

- `be12Edge` + `be11ZurekEdge` calibration edges;
  `composeEdges(be12Edge, be11ZurekEdge)` derives the Zurek
  decoherence scaling Γ_dec = γ·Δx²·m·k_B·T/(2πℏ²) (relErr ≤ 1e-12;
  the classic ~10⁴⁰ macroscopicity anchor pinned). Pre-registered in
  v0.8.0-Design.md §9 in a commit PRECEDING the implementation —
  Part-IX's Phase-B bar (≥3 of C1–C5) now stands at C1 ✓, C4 ✓,
  C5-partial.

### Added — second pass (all remaining improvement-plan suggestions)

- **CT-4 (C5 complete) → Part-IX Phase-B bar MET** (≥3 of C1–C5: C1
  CT-3, C4 CT-1, C5 CT-2+CT-4 — every target pre-registered before
  implementation): `be37Edge` + the parameter-free cross-observable
  ratio Δt/Δφ = a(1−e²)ln(R_far/R_near)/(3πc).
- **G-4**: speculative application/risk essays relocated from Part-V/VI
  to `docs/essays/` (Part-VI 770 → 299 lines); Status-Promotion
  Protocol kept in core as §XXVII-B.
- **Type gate fully strict**: all 71 legacy tests/bench type errors
  fixed (vitest-4 `benchmarkTimeout` removals, sanctioned
  `as unknown as` for deliberate-malformed entries, `.js` import fix,
  `as const` kind literals); the diff-gate baseline is now EMPTY.
- **BE-25 orch-or module archived in place** (@deprecated banner, P-4
  overlay-not-deletion) — closes the deferred archive-or-delete item.
- **G-9 design note** shipped (`v0.10.0-Units-Normalization-Design-Note.md`)
  + todo queue entry; implementation deliberately deferred one cycle
  (one foundation change per cycle — the metric-layout migration just
  landed under the same pipeline).

### Fixed

- PG pipeline bench silently benched NaN post-migration (vet H-1) —
  unflatten shim added; semantic validity restored.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-11

Composition MVP + first real-data confrontation + catalog adjudication.

**Dep-health snapshot (release pre-flight):** `npm audit` — 0
vulnerabilities; `npm outdated` — @types/node 25.9.1→25.9.3 and vitest
4.1.7→4.1.8 (both within-range patches, deferred). Suite **2182
passed / 0 failed / 5 skipped / 1 todo** (209 files); tsc + build +
smoke clean.

> Version adjudication (design r2-6): this body of work owns the
> **v0.8.0** label; the Float64Array hygiene sprint queued in `todo.md`
> (whose own Decision #2 had claimed v0.8.0) renumbers to v0.9.0.
> Implements `docs/planning/v0.8.0-Improvement-Plan.md` top picks via
> `v0.8.0-Design.md` r2 (Adam-vetted) + 8-phase plan. Suite
> 2126 → **2181 passed** (+55; 209 files); tsc/build/smoke clean.

### Added — composition graph (G-1, G-8, P-1, P-3; Part-IX Phase B)

- **`src/composition/`** — graph-lite layer beside the catalog:
  `Quantity` (sparse regime attributes), `BridgeEdge` (n-ary sources,
  first-class `ValidityDomain` predicates — G-8), `composeEdges()`
  (junction by name or reviewable `QUANTITY_IDENTIFICATIONS`; exact
  ℤ⁷ dimension-functor check; min-confidence demotion; domain piping),
  `consistencyRatio()`, typed composition errors. 16 new public
  exports. The operator is `composeEdges` — `compose` remains the v0.7
  Cell factory.
- **Pre-registered targets all passing** (registered in the design
  BEFORE implementation):
  - **CT-1**: `composeEdges(be42Edge, be16Edge)` DERIVES the erasure
    cost at the horizon, E_min(M) = ℏc³ln2/(8πGM), to relErr ≤ 1e-12 —
    the first literature-anchored relation the framework derives rather
    than encodes (Hawking 1975 ∘ Landauer 1961, through the recorded
    T_H ≡ T identification). Realizes Part-IX C4.
  - **CT-1b**: 3-edge chain through the first diagonal-LAW edge
    (Schwarzschild radius, P-1) ≡ direct composition ≡ closed form.
  - **CT-2**: BE-51/BE-52 shared-source consistency ratio
    α/Δφ = 2a(1−e²)/(3πb), M-independent across 3 decades.

### Added — GW170817 → BE-36 real-data confrontation (G-3)

- `confrontBE36()` + the `GW170817` observation record recompute the
  published speed-of-gravity bounds (+6.502e-16 / −3.0865e-15 from
  Δt = 1.74 s, D = 26 Mpc conservative, delay ∈ [0,10] s; published
  +7e-16 / −3e-15 verified as their 1-sig-fig roundings). Honest
  finding: BE-36's encoded symmetric |ratio| ≤ 1e-15 is violated by the
  published asymmetric bound's negative side — recorded in the result
  object and the corrected BE-36 docstring (40 → 26 Mpc derivation).

### Added — membership criterion + negative catalog (G-2, P-4)

- `src/bridges/membership.ts`: *a bridge is an edge whose endpoint
  quantities differ in ≥1 regime attribute* — computable, with the
  `rejected.ts` negative catalog as adjudication overlay.
- Nine `['unknown','unknown']` entries adjudicated (44 → 36 bridges /
  5 not-a-bridge / 3 contested): **BE-42 REVERSED to a bridge**
  (`['gravity','quantum']`; resolves the deferred Adam-HIGH dispute —
  submittable count 22 → 23); BE-28/29/32/35/40 NOT-A-BRIDGE upheld
  with reasons + citations (BE-29 resolves the deferred Adam-MEDIUM
  reconsider); BE-44/46/50 contested, recorded as standing
  physicist-review tasks. Report:
  `docs/architecture/v0.8.0-catalog-adjudication.md`.

### Added — infrastructure (G-5, G-6, G-10, P-2, P-5)

- **CI**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (Node 20: npm ci + tsc + vitest)
  — first CI in the repo.
- **Property-based tests**: `fast-check` devDep; dimensional-algebra
  abelian-group laws + composition meet-semilattice/associativity laws.
- **JSON catalog artifact**: `data/bridge-catalog.json` + schema +
  `npm run catalog:json` + freshness drift-guard (catalog edits fail
  until regenerated) — the physicist-facing review surface.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: six bounded physicist tasks + dev quick-start.
- **Part-VI §XXX-B Status-Promotion Protocol**: LLM consensus never
  sufficient; `established` requires a human-verifiable literature
  anchor; data-driven promotions must be re-runnable.

### Changed — post-vet punch-list (pre-tag cleanups)

- `composeEdges` no longer double-evaluates the first edge (the
  composed `evaluate` computes the intermediate once and checks both
  domains inline; the standalone domain predicate keeps the documented
  D-5 behavior).
- Composed edges now carry `identificationUsed` provenance when the
  junction matched via a quantity identification rather than a name
  (the previously unused `findJunction` return, surfaced).
- `membership-surface.ts` barrel removed — the negative catalog
  re-exports travel with `membership.ts` directly.
- Solar mass promoted to `core/constants.ts` as `M_SUN_SI` (new public
  export); `M_SUN_KG` remains as a stable alias.

### Fixed

- `tools/create-dependency-graph` undeclared `js-yaml` dependency
  (preexisting; generator failed on fresh installs) — added as devDep;
  dependency graph + TEST_COVERAGE regenerated with the new modules.
- Living architecture docs refreshed at the post-implementation gate
  (ARCHITECTURE/OVERVIEW/COMPONENTS/API/DATAFLOW: 44-bridge counts,
  v0.8.0 layers, suite numbers; COMPONENTS' false "no runtime circular
  dependency" claim corrected — `core/cell.ts` ↔ `core/tensor.ts`
  exists); BRIDGE-PHYSICS-AUDIT-v2 got an append-only disposition
  update.

## [0.7.3] — 2026-05-25

**Patch release: expanded MathTS optional-peer surface.** No source changes; declaration-only.

Following today's MathTS monorepo release sweep (6 new workspace packages published to npm — see [Mathts/TODO.md item #1](https://github.com/danielsimonjr/MathTS)), UPT now declares the full MathTS ecosystem as opt-in peers. This is **aspirational declaration**: UPT source doesn't yet consume any of the new packages, but the declarations signal roadmap intent and let consumers pre-install the peer chain they'd need for future UPT features. None of these are required to use UPT — `MathTSEngine` only activates when `mathts-tensor` + `mathts-autograd` are present (unchanged behavior from v0.7.0).

### Added (optionalDependencies)

- `@danielsimonjr/mathts-expression@^0.2.0` — unblocks the P4 Bridge DSL horizon item per `todo.md` (was "BLOCKED on `mathts-expression` peer install" before this release)
- `@danielsimonjr/mathts-matrix@^0.1.3` — for future matrix-engine alternatives
- `@danielsimonjr/mathts-functions@^0.2.1` — special functions for future physics-numerics integrations
- `@danielsimonjr/mathts-parallel@^0.2.0` — for the future browser/multi-core `TensorEngine` horizon item
- `@danielsimonjr/mathts-workerpool@^0.2.0` — worker-pool primitive backing the parallel path
- `@danielsimonjr/mathts-wasm@^0.1.3` — WASM acceleration for future hot-path numerics

### Dep-health snapshot (release pre-flight, 2026-05-25)

- `npm install --include=optional`: 16 new packages added (6 MathTS + 10 transitive), 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run build`: clean (TS 6.0.3)
- `npm test`: **2126 passed / 0 failed / 5 skipped / 1 todo** — identical to v0.7.2 (no source change → no test-surface change)

### Honest accounting

- **Why declare without code?** The declarations remove the "BLOCKED on peer install" qualifier from the P4 Bridge DSL horizon item (and analogous future items for parallel/wasm). They also let consumers `npm install universal-physics-tensor && npm install @danielsimonjr/mathts-expression` cleanly, surfacing future integrations earlier in the development cycle. The downside is "aspirational dep declaration" — these declarations create maintenance signal even before they're used.
- **What does NOT change**: UPT's actual runtime behavior, public API, MathTSEngine integration. v0.7.3 = v0.7.2 + 6 lines in `package.json`.

---

## [0.7.2] — 2026-05-25

**Patch release: MathTS AD integration fix surfaced by the typed-function EOVERRIDE resolution.** Fixes 8 newly-activated test failures that had been hidden behind `.skipIf(true)` peer-gating since v0.4.0.

### Context

The typed-function EOVERRIDE fix (`danielsimonjr/typed-function#5711dab`, pushed earlier this session) finally allowed the `@danielsimonjr/mathts-*` optional-peer chain to install cleanly in UPT. That install activated 23 previously-skipped MathTS integration tests — of which 8 immediately failed, revealing two latent bugs that had been invisible since the integration code was written:

### Fixed

- **`MathTSEngine.add/sub/mul/scale` lacked AD-dispatch (Pattern A — 6 failures).** When the AD path lifts the input `x` to a `DualTensor` (forward) or `TapedTensor` (reverse) from `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd`, the engine's arithmetic methods receive the wrapped tensor. The S1-fix comments in the code documented the intended dispatch pattern but the dispatch was never *implemented* — `unwrap()` threw `NumericalBackendError: MathTSEngine.mul: operand is not a MathTSEngineTensor` instead of routing to `DualTensor.mul` / `TapedTensor.mul`. Fix: duck-typed dispatch (`'tangent' in arg` for forward, `'tape' in arg` for reverse) mirroring `Float64ReferenceEngine`'s `instanceof EngineDualTensor / EngineTapedTensor` pattern, but using runtime structural checks since `mathts-autograd` is an optional peer and cannot be statically imported.
- **`mathts-engine-typing.test.ts` ran absence-path tests when peer was present (Pattern B — 2 failures).** Tests literally named *"forwardGrad throws EngineCapabilityError when mathts-autograd is absent"* fired their assertions when the peer was *present*, getting `NumericalBackendError` instead of `EngineCapabilityError` (because `forwardGrad` was called with a `Float64Tensor`, which `unwrap()` rejects). Fix: gate these tests behind an additional `autogradAbsent` check; skip them with a clearly-named placeholder when the peer is present.

### Validation

- **Suite: 2103 (v0.7.1) → 2126 passed (+23 net new tests activated)**, 0 failed, 5 skipped (3 PC-1.5 long-run + 1 mathts-engine-typing absence-path + 1 other), 1 todo. The +23 are the engine-conformance MathTS half (now running both Float64 and MathTS engines through the same AD contract) and the `mathts-autograd.test.ts` adapter check.
- `npm install --include=optional` cleanly populates `node_modules/@danielsimonjr/` with `mathts-autograd`, `mathts-core`, `mathts-tensor` — the first time this has worked locally since the EOVERRIDE was introduced.
- `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities.

### Honest accounting

- **The bugs predate v0.7.2** — they have been latent in UPT's `MathTSEngine` since v0.4.0 (when the peer-gated tests were first marked `.skipIf(true)`). v0.7.2 is the patch release in which they were both *discovered* and *fixed*. Consumers who previously imported `MathTSEngine` and used the AD methods (`forwardGrad`/`reverseGrad`) with a real `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd` install would have hit the Pattern A bug. v0.7.2 fixes that.
- **Lesson**: deferred test enablement that depends on an optional peer is a special kind of silent debt — the gate (`.skipIf(true)`) prevents validation in *every* environment (local, CI, peer-installed contributor) until the gate itself is reconsidered. The right pattern for peer-gated tests is `describe.skipIf(!peerPresent)`, not `.skipIf(true)`. Captured as a v0.8 execution lesson in `todo.md`.

### Closes

- The "P8 real-AD test enablement" horizon item in `todo.md` is now *partially live*: the engine-conformance AD contract runs against `MathTSEngine` whenever the peer is present. The remaining open work is the v0.9 Phase 2 spec (AD-vs-analytic gradient assertions for specific bridge equations).

## [0.7.1] — 2026-05-25

**Patch release: dev-dep validation under newer toolchain.** No source changes. The published `dist/` is rebuilt with TypeScript 6.0.3 (v0.7.0 published with `^6.0.3` declared but `dist/` was built with TS 5.9.3 — see honest accounting in the v0.7.0 entry). Closes the declared-but-not-installed half-state surfaced in the post-v0.7.0 audit.

### Changed

- **Dev-dep installs refreshed** to match declarations in `package.json`. Prior state: `@types/node@24.12.2`, `typescript@5.9.3`, `vitest@4.1.4` installed; declared `^25.9.1` / `^6.0.3` / `^4.1.7`. Post-install state: all three at declared versions. Full suite (2103/0/5/1) re-validated under the new toolchain — no regressions.
- **`dist/` rebuilt under TS 6.0.3** + `@types/node` 25.9.1. Output layout unchanged (468 files / 3.1 MB across `core`/`bridges`/`dimensional`/`numerical`/`diff`), but emitted `.d.ts` / `.js` bytes differ subtly between TS major versions. Consumers in TS-strict mode may pick up newer type-only constructs (TS 6's emit conventions). No API surface change.
- **`package-lock.json`** regenerated to reflect the resolved-version updates.

### Dep-health snapshot (release pre-flight, 2026-05-25)

- `npm audit`: **0 vulnerabilities**
- `npm outdated`: clean — no outdated deps in the `^X` range
- `npm run build`: clean (TS 6.0.3 strict mode)
- `npm test`: **2103 passed / 0 failed / 5 skipped / 1 todo** under vitest 4.1.7

### Known limitation (carried into 0.7.1; documented for future-resolution)

- **MathTS optional peers (`@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor`, `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd`) cannot be installed locally** due to an upstream `EOVERRIDE` conflict in `typed-function` (a transitive dep of `mathts-core`): typed-function's own `package.json` has `overrides: { "@rollup/plugin-terser": "^0.4.4" }` that conflicts with a direct dependency in the same file, causing `npm install` to silently skip the optional peers (and their dependents). Consumers who try `npm install universal-physics-tensor` will see the same skip — UPT itself works fine since the peers are optional and gated by runtime presence-checks (e.g., `tests/numerical/mathts-engine-*` files use the `optional-dep` gating pattern). The fix lives upstream in `~/Dropbox/Github/typed-function/package.json` — re-publishing typed-function with the override conflict resolved would unblock the full MathTS install chain. Tracked as a follow-up; the P8 horizon item ("real-AD test enablement when CI installs the autograd peer") is also blocked on this.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-25

**Tag decision**: single v0.7.0 rolling everything (per user, 2026-05-25) — subsumes the v0.6.0 tag (never published to npm) plus the v0.6.1 hygiene sprint (never tagged) plus the six v0.7-series proposals plus the v0.7 hygiene follow-up plus the v0.7.1 hygiene sprint. Jumps registry 0.5.1 → 0.7.0.

**Dep-health snapshot (release pre-flight, 2026-05-25)**:
- `npm audit`: **0 vulnerabilities**
- `npm outdated`: 3 deferred majors (@types/node 25.x, typescript 6.x — both devDeps, both flagged for a dedicated dep-bump release; vitest declared at 4.1.7 with installed 4.1.4 — install lag, non-blocking for publish since vitest is a devDep)
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean
- `npm run build`: clean (468 files / 3.1 MB across all five subsystems, replacing the stale v0.1.0-era dist/)
- `npm test`: 2103 passed / 0 failed / 5 skipped / 1 todo (after Windows path-separator fix landed for the v0.7.1 public-surface guard test)

**Six v0.7-series proposals shipped + v0.7 hygiene/audit follow-up sprint + v0.7.1 hygiene sprint**, on branch `claude/changelog-todo-sync-9PdMg` (now merged to master). Suite carried from **1675 (post v0.6.1 phases) → 2103 (+428 net new tests across the full v0.7 cycle)**, 0 failed throughout. Public surface delta: **+44 symbols** across the six proposals (P3: 7, P2: 10, P1: 12, P5: 16, P8: 7, P6: 0 docs-only) plus the v0.7 follow-up additions (Klein-Gordon equation node, Painlevé-Gullstrand metric, field-equation helpers — see "v0.7 hygiene follow-up" below). All six proposals went through an Adam+Eve adversarial-review cycle (Opus-subagent stand-ins per session pragma — Gemini/OpenAI MCP tools unavailable), with redraft+re-vet on P2 for 3 SHOWSTOPPER-class findings caught in first pass.

### v0.7 hygiene + audit follow-up sprint (2026-05-23)

After the six proposals shipped, a focused hygiene sprint worked down the backlog of carry-forwards, audits, and design notes. **Pattern observation: 7 of N audit-recommendation references in this sprint were stale by at least 40% from HEAD reality** — memorialized as the v0.7 execution lesson "verify carry-forward release-note numbers by re-running the tool at HEAD before treating them as work scope" (`todo.md` → execution lessons).

Stale-carry-forward closures:
- **PC-1.5 Shapiro residual** (3-release carry-forward): documented 2.51e-4, actual at HEAD **2.28e-8** — 4 orders of magnitude tighter. v0.6.0 BR-2 christoffelFn→Float64Array(64) refactor silently fixed it; never re-measured. Smoke gate `tests/numerical/be37-shapiro-step-sweep.test.ts` pins relErr in `[1e-10, 1e-6]`; long-run sweep gated behind `GL4_LONG=1`. Findings doc: `docs/architecture/v0.7-pc15-shapiro-floor.md`.
- **AS-3 `schwarzschildPin` helper** (v0.5.1 carry-forward): documented ~65 invocation sites, actual at HEAD **8**. Closed WON'T-DO — helper overkill at that scale.
- **BE-module exports triage** (v0.6.1 Phase 3 carry-forward): documented ~85 unused exports, actual at HEAD **61**. Applied bucket-(a) drops on 20 confirmed-zero-importer constants/validators across 14 BE files; bucket-(a') `@internal` JSDoc annotation pass on the remaining 40 `*Inputs` interfaces. Audit doc: `docs/architecture/v0.7-be-module-exports-audit.md`.
- **Vitest 4.1.4 async-bench reporter limitation** (v0.4.5 carry-forward): closed at vitest 4.1.7 (patched via dep bump). Async benches now print full per-bench hz tables (4,258.52 hz for BE-37 RK4; 2.18 hz for covariant-eikonal).
- **Unknown↔unknown bridge count "~9"** (BRIDGE-PHYSICS-AUDIT §3): actual count at HEAD **26**. Inventory compiled at `docs/architecture/v0.7-unknown-unknown-bridges-inventory.md`.
- **Near-horizon Kretschmann scope estimate** (in-session design note): estimated ~600 LOC across 4 files; actual implementation **~300 LOC** (the architectural question dissolved because `computeKretschmann` was already coordinate-agnostic).
- **BE-33 `−ν/z` exponent fix** (BRIDGE-PHYSICS-AUDIT §4 audit recommendation): already corrected to `-1/z` on 2026-05-20 before the audit recommendation was even written — the audit doc itself was stale.

`lowering.ts` v0.6.1 sprint-target miss (903 vs ≤890 LOC) closed:
- Extracted `tensor-partial-derivative` + `covariant-derivative` arms (~298 LOC) into new `src/numerical/derivative-lowering.ts` (341 LOC) + `src/numerical/lowering-utils.ts` (72 LOC). Track-B's medium-risk forward-import concern resolved via thunk pattern (`recur: LowerNodeRecur` parameter — acyclic module graph). `lowering.ts` 903 → **597 LOC** (beat ≤890 target by 293).

Painlevé-Gullstrand near-horizon Kretschmann (v0.6.0 deferred item):
- `src/numerical/painleve-gullstrand-metric.ts` (closed-form PG metric + inverse; regular at r=r_s). The architectural question "parallel pipeline vs flag vs `*PG` family" dissolved during implementation — `computeKretschmann` already takes raw arrays (coordinate-agnostic). 9 tests cover far-field through inside-horizon: at r=r_s exactly (Schwarzschild-coords-impossible), inside r=0.5·r_s (also Schwarzschild-coords-impossible). Closes 3-release deferred work.

TensorEquationNode<LHS,RHS> generalization (v0.6.0 E-6 deferred):
- **Phase 0** (helper extraction): `src/dimensional/field-equation-helpers.ts` with `validateFreeIndexLabelMatch` / `validateComponentDimension` / `validateTensorSymmetry`. `validateEinsteinFieldEquation` refactored to delegate (behavior-preserving; error keywords `"index label"` / `"dimension"` / `"symmetry"` pinned).
- **Phase 1** (first new field-equation node): `src/dimensional/klein-gordon-equation.ts` — `KleinGordonEquationNode` for `(□+m²)φ = J`. Thin validator (~40 LOC) demonstrates the Phase 0 helper-extraction's payoff vs the pre-extraction ~80 LOC body.
- Phase 1+ for BE-13/19/39/50 re-encodings (TensorTraceNode, FriedmannEquationNode, BetaFunctionNode, GaugeFieldNode + TimeSymmetryPredicateNode) design-noted at `docs/architecture/v0.7-be-x-reencoding-design-note.md` for follow-up sessions. Recommended order: BE-13 → BE-39 → BE-50 → BE-19.

BRIDGE-PHYSICS-AUDIT §1 + §3 + §4 + §5 follow-ups:
- **§1 structural finding**: added optional `encoded_form?: string` field to `BridgeEquationEntry` documenting WHAT the AST encoding represents when it differs from `formula_latex`. Applied to BE-13, BE-47, BE-48 (the encoding-reductions the audit identified).
- **§3 unknown↔unknown naming**: 17 bridges renamed to mappable regime pairs; 9 classified NOT-A-BRIDGE per audit §3 bridge-incoherence. Per-bridge `notes:` footnotes with confidence tier + rationale. Conflict-analysis doc at `docs/architecture/v0.7-bridge-status-recalibration-analysis.md`; physics-judgment proposals doc at `docs/architecture/v0.7-physics-judgment-proposals.md`.
- **§4 BE-34 Boltzmann factor**: notes append documenting Adam's cosmological-KZM-with-massive-defects rationale (Linde 1990) + Eve's mechanism-conflict concern. Status stays `'speculative'` to flag the multiplicative-combination element.
- **§5 status recalibration**: 1 status flip (BE-14 `'established'` → `'speculative'`) + 3 notes footnotes (BE-16/29/40 keep current status with audit-considered rationale) + 1 deferral (BE-34 coupled to Boltzmann dispute).

Dev-dep bumps (major + patches):
- `typescript`: 5.9.3 → **6.0.3** (major; one-line tsconfig fix `"types": ["node"]` resolved the `process`/`console`/`globalThis.crypto` regressions).
- `@types/node`: 24.12.2 → **25.9.1** (major; same tsconfig fix).
- `vitest`: 4.1.4 → 4.1.7 (patch; side-benefit: closed the v0.4.5 async-bench reporter limitation).

Pre-flight log shipped at `docs/architecture/v0.7-release-preflight-log.md`. All 5 blocking pre-tag checks pass (npm audit 0 vulnerabilities; npm outdated within-range deps up-to-date; tsc strict clean; smoke OK). **Pre-tag verdict: READY** when user decides on tag-strategy option.

### v0.7.1 hygiene sprint — Phases 0-6 COMPLETE (with O-1 deferred) (2026-05-25)

Sprint working down the 42-candidate Minimize/Simplify/Optimize brainstorm at `docs/planning/v0.7.1-brainstorm-{minimize,simplify,optimize}.md` against the consolidated 6-phase design at `docs/planning/v0.7.1-Design.md`. All six phases landed; one optimize-axis candidate (O-1, Schwarzschild fixture Float64Array migration) deferred to v0.7.2 due to ~20+ direct-index callsite churn. Suite: 2057 (Phase 0 baseline) → **2103 passed / 0 failed / 5 skipped / 1 todo** (+46 net new). No public-surface deletion; net-add only per design Decision #2.

**Phase 0** (baseline + per-candidate verification, `49cf47f`):
- Captured suite/build baseline at HEAD `f11eee1`. Documented 3 drifts: M-1 candidate is 5 modules not 7 (field-equation-helpers + validator-registry have NO `@public` tags — correctly internal); M-3 candidate is 45 *Inputs interfaces not ~37; M-5 candidate is 30 validators (broader than just BE-NN names). Design adjusted accordingly before Phase 1 dispatch. Baseline doc: `docs/architecture/v0.7.1-baseline.md`.

**Phase 1** (Surface restoration M-1 + guard test + tooling, `288a45c`):
- New invariant test `tests/api/public-tag-vs-index-invariant.test.ts` walks `src/**/*.ts`, parses every `@public`-tagged declaration, and asserts each is reachable from `src/index.ts`. Allowlist `PRE_V071_ACCEPTED_DRIFT` (44 entries) freezes pre-existing debt so future drift fails the build.
- 5 v0.7 primitive modules re-exported from `src/index.ts`: `tensor-trace`, `friedmann-equation`, `rg-flow`, `gauge-field`, `klein-gordon-equation` (closes M-1).
- `tools/create-dependency-graph/create-dependency-graph.ts` patches: M-13 `reExportNamedRegex` now matches `export type { ... } from`; M-14a side-effect-only imports (`import './foo.js'`) now parsed; M-14b `.ambient.d.ts` files skipped in unused-file detection. Result: 95 → 60 captured unused exports; 4 → 0 unused files.

**Phase 2** (Mass-annotation pass M-3 + M-4 + M-5, `b951580` + `8bffcef` + `8fc13d8` + `9f246eb`):
- 42 of 45 `*Inputs` interfaces had `export` dropped (3 retained: `DecoherenceRateInputs`, `ShapiroInputs`, `HawkingTemperatureInputs` — actual consumers in `src/diff/bridge-specs.ts`). 3 batches.
- 33 `*_LHS` constants + 39 `validate*Dimensions` functions tagged `/** @internal */` (M-4 + M-5).

**Phase 3 complete** (BE-NN triple-extraction, HIGHEST-STAKES, `2748566` + `cae3976` + `da98b98` + `094e03e` + `1eb7798` + `29f4041`):
- Task 3.1: `src/bridges/equations/_be-helpers.ts` — 3 shared helpers (`validateFiniteInputs`, `validateBEDimensions`, `sym` factory) + 43 unit tests. Closes S-1 (`sym` factory duplicated across all 43 BE modules) + S-2 (input-validation boilerplate) + S-3 (`validateEquation` + `validate(LHS)` + `validate(RHS)` triple-redundancy).
- Task 3.2 batches 1-4: applied helpers to BE-11..54 (43 BE modules — full catalog migrated). Cumulative net diff across helpers + tests + migration + rg-flow: **+746 / -1071 LOC** (net -325 LOC; migration-only: +514 / -1071). Re-measured at HEAD `b6cc8df` (Eve E2 honesty fix).
- Task 3.3: `src/dimensional/rg-flow.ts` `validateRGCoupling` Predicate 2 + `validateBetaFunction` Predicate 4 migrated from inline `equals(...) → throw` blocks to `validateComponentDimension` from `field-equation-helpers.ts`. Closes S-8 + BRIDGE-PHYSICS-AUDIT v2 Adam-MEDIUM #2 simultaneously.

**Honest-claude per-module deviations** (batch 4, expected per design):
- **BE-44 (soft-hair)**: array shape checks (`Array.isArray`, per-element loop on `news_samples[i]`) stayed inline — `FieldSpec` doesn't drill into array elements. Only `du` migrated.
- **BE-48 (GRW)**: optional fields with defaults — a `resolved` object applied defaults before the helper call.
- **BE-50 (Wheeler-Feynman)**: `denom === 0` division-by-zero guard stayed inline (relational, not per-field range).
- **BE-53 (Yang-Mills)**: file-local `sym` had a different signature (`(name) → DIMENSIONLESS-pinned`); each call rewritten to `sym(name, DIMENSIONLESS)`. No `validateBE53Dimensions` exists in this module.
- **BE-41 (swampland)**: combined `phi/phi0` finite-check split into two `FieldSpec` entries — tests assert only `RangeError`, safe.

**Mid-cycle Adam+Eve vet** (commits `af8c813` Adam + `1023210` Eve, opus subagent stand-ins per session pragma):

- **Adam — GREEN** (0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM / 2 LOW). Verdict: Phase 4 may proceed. `sym()` factory (design's flagged highest-risk extraction) is a 1:1 literal reproduction with 14 dedicated unit tests pinning kind/name/dim preservation. `validateBEDimensions` LHS/RHS order correct across all spot-checked modules. `validateFiniteInputs` semantics preserved. `rg-flow` Task 3.3 preserves `actual=node.dim, expected=DIMENSIONLESS` order. 2 LOWs: BE-48 GRW destructure-default switched to `??` nullish-coalesce (equivalent for TS callers, only differs for JS callers passing `null`); cosmetic error-message prose drift. Report: `docs/architecture/v0.7.1-phase3-adam-vet.md`.

- **Eve — YELLOW** (0 HIGH / 3 MEDIUM / 3 LOW). Verdict: Phase 4 unblocked, 3 honesty fixes recommended. **E1 fixed in this CHANGELOG**: Phase 3 commit-hash citations had cited the agent-worktree hashes (`f5ebe51` etc.) instead of the cherry-picked hashes on `claude/changelog-todo-sync-9PdMg` (`2748566` etc.). **E2 fixed in this CHANGELOG**: LOC count was `+500 / -1057` claimed vs `+746 / -1071` actual at HEAD (Eve's `+529 / -1086` migration-only number used a different commit pair; my re-measurement at HEAD `b6cc8df` is `+514 / -1071` migration-only). **E4 deferred to Phase 4 ride-along**: BE-25-iit-phi error message regressed from "must be a finite probability in [0,1]" to grammatically awkward "must be a finite in range [0,1] number" — domain noun "probability" lost. Helper needs a `description` adjective override; tests still pass (RangeError class only). Report: `docs/architecture/v0.7.1-phase3-eve-vet.md`.

Eve's fabrication rate ~0% — every finding has a file:line citation + re-runnable verification; 3 of 8 brief axes explicitly returned "NO FINDING after check" (axes 2/6/7+8) rather than padding.

**Phase 4 complete** (Simplify Phase B, `25d43dd` + `2a86611` + `94c2e82` + `7ffd975`, 4 commits + 3 net-new tests):
- Task 4.1 (`25d43dd`): S-5 + S-6 dedup cleanup. Dropped 3 private helpers (`_dimensionOf`/`_requireValue`/`_flattenNestedArray`) from `curvature-lowering-helpers.ts:599-621`; route through public equivalents in `lowering-utils.ts`. Dropped `dimEquals` re-impl from `friedmann-equation.ts:167`; use existing `equals` from `dimensional/algebra.ts`.
- Task 4.2 (`2a86611`): S-13 pattern-B validator consolidation. Extracted `RiemannChildCallback` type alias to `curvature.ts` (NOT `validator-registry.ts` — would create import cycle); `@internal`-tagged (initial `@public` caught by the Phase 1 `public-tag-vs-index-invariant` guard test). 3 inline callback shapes consolidated.
- Task 4.3 (`94c2e82`): S-14 `mergeFreeIndices` dedup. **Brainstorm count was STALE** (predicted 5×, actual at HEAD **8×**); extracted helper + replaced all 8 instances. The 2 surviving `for (const [label, counts] of ...)` loops (in `freeIndicesEqual` + `formatFreeIndices`) are equality/stringify — not merges — left untouched.
- Task 4.4 (`7ffd975`): Eve E4 BE-25 prose regression fix. Added `description?: string` optional field to `FieldSpec` in `_be-helpers.ts`; `describeRange()` prefers it over auto-generated "in range" prose. BE-25 callsite updated; +3 unit tests (range-branch, non-finite branch, bound-check-still-fires).

**Phase 5 partial** (Optimize Paired Commit, `707a2f7`, O-2 only):
- Task 5.2 (`707a2f7`): O-2 Picard ping-pong buffer pre-allocation in `solveGL4Stage`. Replaced 4 per-iteration `number[][]` allocations (worst-case 50 iter × 4 allocs/iter = ~200 allocs/step) with 8 pre-allocated `Float64Array` buffers swapped by parity. Caller-safe via clone-on-return (2 small allocs/converged step).
- **Bench-measured speedup** (`bench/gl4-picard-alloc.bench.ts`): single GL4 stage **2742.39 hz → 3490.50 hz = 1.27×**; 100-stage batch **27.34 → 35.30 hz = 1.29×**. Below the brainstorm's "2-5×" target — that prediction assumed paired O-1.
- **O-1 DEFERRED to v0.7.2**: Schwarzschild fixture `gInverseFn` / `dgInverseFn` migration to `Float64Array(16)` / `Float64Array(64)` is the BR-2 sibling, but the migration surface is ~20+ callsites including many tests with direct `gInv[μ][ν]` and `dg[λ][μ][ν]` indexing that need coordinated rewriting. Parallel-agent dispatch hit infrastructure friction (subagent reported edits being reverted; could not land); the work needs a dedicated session. O-6 PG ride-along likewise deferred.

**Phase 6 complete** (`84115fa`, bench harness additions + benchmarks doc):
- New bench `bench/kretschmann-symmetry.bench.ts` — O-3 baseline (compute-only Kretschmann @ Mercury + near-horizon; full FD-build-+-Kretschmann pipeline). Future symmetry-exploiting variant target (Riemann has 20 indep components in 4D, not 256).
- New bench `bench/painleve-gullstrand-pipeline.bench.ts` — O-6 baseline (PG metric closures across far-field / AT-horizon / inside-horizon + full PG → Riemann → Kretschmann pipeline).
- `docs/architecture/benchmarks.md` appended with v0.7.1 PO-1 post-O-2 numbers (1.27×/1.29× speedup) + the O-3/O-6 bench-harness pointers (no per-machine baseline tables — informational only per design Decision #5).

Version bump 0.7.0 → 0.7.1 SKIPPED per user directive (publish still blocked on token rotation).

**Sprint totals**: 198 → 200 + 2 skipped test files; 2056 → **2103 passed / 0 failed / 5 skipped / 1 todo** (+47 net new from `_be-helpers` unit tests + Phase 4 + Phase 6); 26 sprint commits; 2 new bench harnesses; 2 new mid-cycle vet docs; 4 Adam+Eve review cycles (1 mid-cycle pair + 2 pre-sprint pairs implicit in the brainstorm review). All carry-forward CHANGELOG/todo numbers re-measured at HEAD per the v0.7 stale-carry-forward lesson; Eve E1+E2 honesty fixes applied same-commit-cycle.

### v0.7 BRIDGE-PHYSICS-AUDIT v2 (2026-05-24, parallel Adam+Eve opus reviewers)

Re-audit of the post-v0.7 catalog state (now 44 bridges with BE-53/54 extensions + 17 unknown↔unknown renames + 5 status recalibrations + audit-§1 `encoded_form` field). Adam (per-bridge content review, ~550 LOC) + Eve (red-team gap-finding across 6 axes, ~326 LOC) co-authored `docs/architecture/BRIDGE-PHYSICS-AUDIT-v2.md`.

**Headline verdict**: catalog deltas physics-check clean (**0 INVALID equations**). Five Adam-actionable findings + 13 Eve-gap findings; 2 highest-priority closed same commit cycle.

**Closed immediately** (commit `e2ae944`):

- **Eve-E1** (silent test-coverage gap): `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` in `src/dimensional/bridge-check.ts` did not register BE-53/54; the verification test pinned `.toBe(40)` and iterated ids 11-50 only. The catalog-extension protocol step from `orphan-dimensional-signature.test.ts:37-43` was silently skipped during BE-53/54 ship. **Fixed**: added `[53, DIMENSIONLESS]` (Yang-Mills β of dimensionless coupling) + `[54, T_INV2]` (Randall-Sundrum H² has dim [T^-2]). Test updated to `.toBe(42)` with extended id range. Closes a latent correctness-regression risk — future BE-NN entries that miss the protocol step will now FAIL this assertion instead of silently skipping.
- **Eve-E13** (pre-tag stale pins): Test-count `1854` cited in 3 places across `v0.7-release-preflight-log.md` + `v0.7-release-notes-draft.md` (pre-tag-flow docs); HEAD count is 2056 (+202 drift across the BE-X sprint, BE-53/54 catalog extensions, and the E1 fix). **Fixed**: refreshed both pre-tag docs to HEAD counts; header banner notes the 2026-05-24 update + E13 origin.

**Adam findings deferred to user physics-judgment session** (v0.8 ride-alongs):

- **Adam-HIGH** BE-42 Hawking temperature NOT-A-BRIDGE reversal — Adam argues T_H = ℏc³/(8πGMk_B) IS the archetypal quantum↔gravity bridge (contains ℏ + G in one scalar; undefined without either regime); v0.7 conflated "mis-filed in wrong category" (audit §3 framing finding) with "not a bridge". Recommendation: `bridges: ['quantum', 'gravity']` + drop NOT-A-BRIDGE marker. Adam flagged for Eve-perspective second opinion before applying.
- **Adam-MEDIUM** `encoded_form` mass-population to 13 more entries (BE-17/18/20/21/27/29/32/35/36/42/44/46/50) — selective application re-creates the v1 §1 transparency gap the field was added to close. Mechanical pass; ~30-60 min focused work.
- **Adam-MEDIUM** BE-29 Jarzynski NOT-A-BRIDGE reconsider — Adam argues Jarzynski IS a non-eq ↔ eq bridge; "single-regime statmech" undersells the content. Same single-reviewer caveat as BE-42.

**Eve gap findings deferred** (low-priority ride-alongs):

- Eve-E2-E6 stale carry-forward in 4 historical docs (be-module-exports-audit.md etc.); records of point-in-time state, not pre-tag references.
- Eve-E7 documented as already-deferred — BE-28/33/44/45/47 "slightly strong" demotion question.
- Eve-E8 BE-22/31 marginal renames.
- Eve-E10 BE-54 arXiv refs (arxiv.org returned 403 to WebFetch; needs manual cross-check).
- Eve-E9 consolidate stale-carry-forward retrospective.

### v0.7 catalog extension (2026-05-24, parallel-agent dispatch, sibling to BE-X sprint)

Two new catalog entries shipped via parallel-agent dispatch — exercising the AST primitives the BE-X agents just shipped:

- **BE-53 — Yang-Mills one-loop β-function** (sonnet, `bedd385` + `acae340`): single-coupling `BetaFunctionNode` with `fixedPoint: [0]` (asymptotic-freedom UV-FP). Structural dual of BE-39's two-coupling NGFP — demonstrates the primitives are flow-direction-agnostic. QCD `b₀=7` (`N_c=3, N_f=6`), pure SU(3) `b₀=11`, asymptotic-freedom boundary at `N_f ≈ 16.5`. Status: `'established'` (Nobel 2004 — Gross/Politzer/Wilczek). 32 tests.
- **BE-54 — Randall-Sundrum brane cosmology** (sonnet, `0ef5253` + `c400185` + follow-up `b8153f6`): exercises BE-19's `'brane'` variant of `FriedmannEquationNode`. Brane-tension correction `(1 + ρ/(2σ))` is dimensionless; `H² ≥ 0` always. Status: `'speculative'` (real framework, experimentally unconstrained). 32 tests (24 raw-AST + 7 structural follow-up + 1 catalog-round-trip).

Catalog: 42 → **44 entries** (BE-51/52 from v0.4.0 + BE-53/54 from v0.7). Suite: 2017 → 2056 (+39 from this batch).

**Pattern note**: agent worktrees forked from variable points (BE-53 from `ccda66a`, saw `rg-flow.ts`; BE-54 from `fb7ff8b`, didn't see `friedmann-equation.ts` and fell back to raw-AST). The 5 catalog-length-pin conflicts during the BE-53 cherry-pick all resolved cleanly. Lesson logged: pre-flight `git merge-base` check helps but doesn't fix; future parallel dispatches should have agents `git pull` + `git rebase` if their worktree HEAD doesn't match `origin/...HEAD`.

### v0.7 BE-X re-encoding sprint (2026-05-24, parallel-agent dispatch)

All four BE-X re-encodings the user approved shipped via parallel-agent dispatch (2× sonnet, 2× opus, isolated worktrees per agent). Each agent ran independently; cherry-picked back onto the main branch with zero conflicts. Suite: 1897 → **1992** (+95).

- **BE-13 (Einstein trace, sonnet)** — `TensorTraceNode` + `TracableTensorNode` structural-interface input. `BE13_T_TRACE_NODE` additive export. +20 tests. (`55a59af` + `f57fad5`)
- **BE-19 (LQC quantum-bounce, opus)** — `FriedmannEquationNode` with 5-variant discriminator (`classical | lqc | brane | dgp | massive`). `BE19_LQC_FRIEDMANN_STRUCTURAL` additive export. +23 tests. Validator pinned to `[M·L^-3]` mass-density convention per BE-19's existing encoding. Agent recommends Randall-Sundrum brane cosmology as next variant exerciser. (`5ebffa8` + `af27132`)
- **BE-39 (asymptotic safety, opus)** — `BetaFunctionNode` + `RGCouplingNode` AST primitives. `BE39_BETA_G_STRUCTURAL` + `BE39_BETA_LAMBDA_STRUCTURAL` additive exports. +28 tests. **Honest deviation**: worktree forked from pre-v0.7 baseline (b67481b); agent improvised against pre-Phase-0 `einstein-equation.ts` instead of the `field-equation-helpers.ts` it didn't see. Functional output correct; style mismatch is a future-cleanup item. Agent recommends BE-26 Yang-Mills β-function as next RG-related BE. (`76afe1e` + `5e7e812`)
- **BE-50 (Wheeler-Feynman, sonnet)** — `GaugeFieldNode` + `TimeSymmetryPredicateNode` with `arrowOfTime` discriminator. `BE50_TIME_SYMMETRY_PREDICATE_STRUCTURAL` additive export with ε=1e-2 (Cramer 1986 §VII experimental bound). +24 tests. (`3860d7b` + `e8d3df0`)

All four used additive-new-export strategy — legacy AST exports + tests unchanged. Zero regressions; build clean (tsc 6.0.3 strict).

Cumulative public-surface delta from the BE-X batch: +4 AST primitive types (`TensorTraceNode`, `FriedmannEquationNode`, `BetaFunctionNode`, `TimeSymmetryPredicateNode`) + 4 helper types (`TracableTensorNode`, `RGCouplingNode`, `GaugeFieldNode`, `ScalarFieldNode` shared) + their validators. None promoted to `src/index.ts` yet (would require coordinated public-surface decision — deferred to tag-time review).

Execution-lesson logged: **verify `git merge-base` of agent worktree branches BEFORE agent starts**. BE-39's worktree forked from `master` rather than the working branch, causing the agent to write against a 200-commit-stale baseline. The functional output worked because the agent's improvisation against pre-Phase-0 code paths happens to cherry-pick cleanly onto the post-Phase-0 base, but the style/architectural deviation is a clear signal — pre-flight a worktree fork-point check in future parallel dispatches.

### v0.8 Proposal 5 — RegimeType Extension System (`src/core/regime-registry.ts`)

### v0.8 Proposal 5 — RegimeType Extension System (`src/core/regime-registry.ts`)

- **`defineRegime(spec)`** + six per-axis convenience APIs (`defineScale` / `defineForce` / `defineSymmetry` / `defineInformation` / `defineDimension` / `defineTopology`) + lookup helpers (`lookupRegime`, `listRegimesByAxis`, `provenanceFor`). Per P5 Decision #1, ships the extension MECHANISM only; closed taxonomy of NEW physics-regime built-ins deferred to v0.9 per-bridge physics review.
- **`src/core/regimes-builtins.ts`** — pre-registers the 18 v0.6-shipped closed-union values at module load (4 scales, 5 forces, **5 symmetries per Eve-M1 correction — NOT 4+placeholder**, 4 information measures). Integer axes (dimension, topology) ship no built-ins (wildcards per P1 census + P5 Decision #4).
- **`attachRegimesToCell(cellId, regimes)` / `getCellRegimes(cellId)`** — per-cell regime attachment via **sibling registry keyed by cell id** (per Adam-M1 resolution: avoids breaking P3's `BridgeCell` surface AND the `cellToBridge` adapter round-trip that would strip unknown fields).
- **`FluxRuleKind` extended** with `'regime-consistency'` discriminator (per Eve-M2 reconciliation): explicit union extension + dispatch case + `_exhaustive: never` re-verification. `src/core/regime-rule-install.ts` installs the rule body via a registered-callable pattern (no circular import); fires WARNING tier on cell-regime mismatch.
- **`RegimeCollisionError`** thrown on `(axis, tag)` re-registration with mismatched content. Idempotent for identical re-registrations per Eve-L1.
- Suite: 1813 → 1835 (+22).

### v0.9 Proposal 8 — Bridge Parameter Differentiation (`src/diff/bridge-gradient.ts`)

- **`bridgeGradient(spec, engine, params)`** — async; reverse-mode AD wrapper over `MathTSEngine.reverseGrad` (which delegates to optional peer `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd`). Returns `{ value: number, gradient: EngineTensor }`. Throws `EngineCapabilityError` when engine lacks AD support (graceful degradation per the v0.4.0 pattern).
- **`gradientToNamed(spec, gradient, engine)`** — unpack helper. Returns `Record<string, number>` keyed by `paramNames`.
- **`BridgeDiffSpec<Input>`** — spec shape with `bridgeId`, `name`, `paramNames`, `defaults`, `evaluate`. Per Decision #1, lives in `src/diff/` (new directory); doesn't touch `src/bridges/`.
- **Four representative specs shipped** (per P8 Eve M1-M3 reconciliation, using verified struct-arg signatures from HEAD):
  - `BE11_DECOHERENCE_DIFF` (`gamma0_per_s, lambda, lambda0`)
  - `BE37_SHAPIRO_DIFF` (`M_kg, R_far_m, R_near_m`)
  - `BE42_HAWKING_DIFF` (`M_kg`)
  - `BE52_PERIHELION_DIFF` (`M_kg, a_m, e` + `T_yr` in defaults; scalar selector extracts `dphi_rad_per_orbit`)
- **Engine-capability matrix** (per audit doc):
  - `Float64ReferenceEngine`: has AD methods but dual-number AD cannot trace plain-JS bridge math (documented honest limitation).
  - `MathTSEngine` + `mathts-autograd` installed: full AD via computational-graph IR.
  - No-AD mock: `EngineCapabilityError` from `bridgeGradient`'s capability check.
- **P8 Adam-H1 honest scope note**: `node_modules/@danielsimonjr/` was EMPTY in the dev env (sandboxed, no registry pull); `npm install --include=optional` was a no-op. Real-AD tests are `describe.skipIf(true)`-marked until the peer is installed in a consumer env. Graceful-degradation surface is fully tested.
- Suite: 1835 → 1853 (+18 + 1 intentional skip).
- Docs: `docs/architecture/v0.7-p8-bridge-gradient-audit.md` (Phase 3) + `docs/architecture/bridge-gradient-tutorial.md` (Phase 4).

### PC-1.5 closure — BE-37 Shapiro residual at FP floor (3-release carry-forward resolved)

- Investigation completed via step-count sweep at HEAD. BE-37 Shapiro relErr at default 2048 GL4 steps is **~2.3e-8** — 4 orders of magnitude tighter than the carry-forward 2.51e-4 number. Sweep at 2048/4096/8192 is non-monotone (2.28e-8 → 5.02e-8 → 2.28e-8), the canonical signature of having hit the FP arithmetic floor rather than integrator truncation. If it were truncation-bound, doubling steps would reduce relErr by ~16× (GL4 is 4th-order). It does not.
- Root cause of the silent fix: v0.6.0's **BR-2 BREAKING refactor** (commit `5c786cc`) migrated `christoffelFn` from nested `number[4][4][4]` to flat `Float64Array(64)` for the 5–6× RK4 speedup. The numerical-stability side effect (fewer intermediate allocations = fewer cumulative round-off injection chances) was never re-measured end-to-end. v0.6.0 PC-1.5 status note said "integrator cleared as suspect" but did not report the residual; v0.6.1/v0.7 release notes inherited the stale 2.51e-4 number unverified.
- Smoke gate: `tests/numerical/be37-shapiro-step-sweep.test.ts` asserts relErr stays in `[1e-10, 1e-6]` band at default steps (catches both improvement and regression). Long-run sweep (`GL4_LONG=1`) reproduces the three step-count numbers for future regression checks.
- Findings doc: `docs/architecture/v0.7-pc15-shapiro-floor.md`.
- Suite: +1 net test (smoke gate; long-run sweep skipped by default).

### v0.8+ Proposal 6 Phase A — Bridge Composition Research Track (docs-only)

- **`docs/specification/Part-IX-Composition.md`** — Phase A research spec (avoiding the existing Part-VII/VIII numbering per Eve-E2). Defines composition operationally: numerical-cascade primary, categorical secondary. Names C1-C5 calibration set with BE-ID citations verified against `src/bridges/index.ts`.
- **`docs/planning/v0.7-Proposal-6-PhaseA-Open-Questions.md`** — five questions Phase B must answer (Q1 composition surface, Q2 tolerance, Q3 flux-rule interaction, Q4 identity morphism, Q5 v1.0 escalation).
- **`docs/planning/v0.7-Proposal-6-PhaseA-Review-Findings.md`** — Adam+Eve reconciliation. Per Adam-F2, the optional `src/composition/` prototype is SKIPPED in Phase A — existing bridge evaluators return ad-hoc TS interfaces with no shared `Observable` contract; the translation-layer design IS Phase B's deliverable.
- Suite: unchanged (docs-only).

### v0.7-p3 — Typed `Cell` discriminated union (`src/core/cell.ts`)

- **`Cell` union** = `LawCell | BridgeCell | EmergenceCell`. Storage-layer surface for `UniversalTensor.addCell(cell)`. Per Eve-R2 / Eve-R3 reconciliation, `confidence` is a string-literal union (`'established' | 'speculative' | 'highly-speculative'`) on the cell variants, NOT a number — the legacy `PhysicalLaw.confidence: number` stays as-is on the legacy interface to preserve catalog-vs-cell autonomy.
- **`compose(laws, bridges, emergences, config)` factory** — disjoint-union construction; consumers build a populated `UniversalTensor` from three typed arrays in one call.
- Public exports added: `Cell`, `CellBase`, `CellConfidence`, `LawCell`, `BridgeCell`, `EmergenceCell` (6 types) + `compose` (1 function) = **7 new public symbols**.
- `UniversalTensor.addCell(cell)` accepts the discriminated union with `_exhaustive: never` default arm.

### v0.7-p2 — Sparse semantic catalog + flux rules

- **`src/core/flux-rules.ts`** — 3-rule registry with `_exhaustive: never` dispatch over `FluxRuleKind = 'dimensional-consistency' | 'lbe-coordinate' | 'causality'`. Rule 2 (L/B/E coordinate matching) is ERROR-tier — throws `FluxViolationError` from `addCell` with fail-atomic rollback. Rule 3 (Causality) is WARNING-tier in v0.7 — emits diagnostic but does not throw; classifies bridges as forward/lateral/reverse via the `SCALE_ORDER` partial-order on `PhysicalScale`. Rule 1 (Dimensional Consistency) fires from the catalog adapter, NOT `addCell` (Decision #3 resolves Adam-V3: `Cell` variants don't carry `dimensional_signature`).
- **`UniversalTensor` integration** — 4 new methods:
  - `populatedCount()` returns unique-coordinate count (fan-out included per Decision #6).
  - `populatedCells()` returns deduped `ReadonlyArray<Cell>` via new inverse adapters `lawToCell` / `bridgeToCell` / `emergenceToCell`.
  - `unpopulatedNeighborhoods()` enumerates single-axis-flip neighbors per Decision #10; integer axes (`dimension`, `topology`) are wildcards.
  - `fluxDiagnostics()` re-runs the rule set across all populated cells; idempotent (no mutable `pendingDiagnostics` field — Eve-R8 resolution).
- **`src/bridges/catalog-adapter.ts`** — `catalogToCells(entries)` pure mapper + `scanCatalog(entries)` best-effort variant + `ingestCatalog(tensor, entries)` strict two-pass (Decision #11). Live BRIDGE_EQUATIONS catalog passes through with **5 submittable / 37 unsubmitted** (entries whose freeform `bridges:` axis labels don't map to the strict `PhysicalScale` union — `microscale`, `emergent`, `information`, `physical`, `consciousness`, `gravity`, `dark-sector`, `condensed-matter`, `holography`, `field-A/B`, `Newtonian gravity`, `general relativity`). Future v0.8 RegimeType (Proposal 5) widens the mappable set.
- **Empirical finding (Eve-R1 lesson held):** structural `dimensional_signature: null` count at HEAD = 0. The whole proposals-doc-attached claim of "1 null in BE-15" was prose inside `notes:`, not a structural field. Rule 1's ERROR-tier configuration is empirically safe at HEAD.
- Public exports added: `FluxDiagnostic`, `FluxReport`, `CatalogEntryStatus`, `CatalogIngestionReport` (4 types) + `FluxViolationError`, `catalogToCells`, `scanCatalog`, `ingestCatalog`, `ingestionReportToFluxReport`, `CatalogIngestionError` (6 values) = **10 new public symbols**. Kept `@internal`: `FluxRule`, `FluxRuleKind`, `FluxRuleResult`.

### v0.7-p1 — Intelligent Index Layer

- **`src/core/universal-index.ts`** — `UniversalIndex<Axis extends AxisName>` with branded `UniversalIndexId` (UUID via `crypto.randomUUID()`). Per Eve verification (proposals doc has zero `prime` / `arrow` mentions), v0.7.0 ships only the §2.2 sketch fields: `id`, `axis`, `name`, `tags?`, `limits?`, `notes?`. `prime`/`arrow` (ITensor parity) explicitly deferred to v0.8.0+.
- **`src/core/axes-registry.ts`** — `Axes` module singleton, 18 frozen `UniversalIndex` references at module load (4 scales + 5 forces + 5 symmetries + 4 information measures, per Phase 0 census). Same object across all import sites; `Object.freeze` outer + inner.
- **`src/core/labeled-tensor.ts`** — wrapper class composing `EngineTensor` + `TensorEngine` + labels record. `contract(other)` matches strictly by `UniversalIndexId` equality (Decision #3); two indices with same axis/name but distinct ids do NOT contract. Per Decision #1 (adapter-on-top), `TensorSymbolNode` and `computeContraction` remain UNCHANGED — verified at HEAD via diff-grep. 4 error classes: `LabeledTensorConstructionError`, `AxisMismatchError`, `IdentityConflictError`, `RankPreservationError`.
- **`src/bridges/perihelion-precession-labeled.ts`** — Phase 4 single-bridge demo. Additive `evaluatePerihelionPrecessionLabeled(inputs, engine)` entry point wraps the three perihelion-advance quantities in a rank-1 `LabeledTensor` tagged with `Axes.scale.classical`. Original `evaluatePerihelionPrecession` evaluator untouched (Cross-Phase Invariant 4 preserved).
- **`docs/architecture/intelligent-index-tutorial.md`** — five-minute walkthrough.
- Public exports added: `AxisName`, `UniversalIndex`, `UniversalIndexId`, `MakeIndexOptions`, `AxesRegistry` (5 types) + `makeIndex`, `Axes`, `LabeledTensor`, plus 4 error classes (7 values) = **12 new public symbols**.

### Adversarial review notes (v0.7 session)

- **P3**: design + plan reviewed by Adam (Gemini 2.5 Pro proxy via Opus subagent) + Eve (OpenAI o3 proxy via Opus subagent). All findings reconciled before TDD.
- **P2**: design caught 17 findings across two passes (Adam-V1..V11 + Eve-R1..R19); 3 SHOWSTOPPER-class issues (Adam-V2 compile-blocking, Eve-R1 empirical, Eve-R7 storage-design contradiction) forced a complete redraft of the design before TDD opened. Redraft Adam+Eve pass: 0 HIGH findings, READY verdict.
- **P1**: design Adam+Eve pass during Phase 0 — Adam 0 HIGH / 1 MEDIUM / 3 LOW (Risk 4 falsified at HEAD: `src/numerical/mathts-engine.ts:71-74` shows `einsum(spec, ...)` forwards directly — engine-agnostic claim is empirically dissolved). Eve 1 HIGH (Phase 0 Task 0.4 type-only header doesn't compile as non-abstract class — RESOLVED by dropping the task, Phase 1 writes actual implementation directly) / 2 MEDIUM (Symmetry=5 not 4+placeholder; public-API undercount) / 2 LOW.

### Cross-Phase Invariants verified at HEAD

- `TensorSymbolNode` and `computeContraction` UNCHANGED (P1 invariant 4 + 5) — `git diff` against the v0.7-p1 baseline commit (`090a3ae`) shows zero edits under `src/dimensional/`, `src/numerical/lowering*`, or `src/bridges/equations/`.
- `TensorEngine` interface UNCHANGED across all three proposals.
- v0.6.1 minimize discipline acknowledged: P2 + P1 net-add 22 public symbols; each carries `@public` JSDoc per Decision #10.

### Suite + build

- **Build clean** (tsc strict) at every commit.
- **Suite: 1675 (P3 start) → 1813 passed (+138 net new)**, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 1 todo across 186 test files + 2 skipped (`mathts-engine` optional-dep gated).
- **Pre-tag steps EXECUTED 2026-05-25** (the original session deferred these; ship session completed them):
  - `npm audit` — 0 vulnerabilities.
  - `npm outdated` — 2 deferred majors (`@types/node` 25.x, `typescript` 6.x; both devDeps). Documented for a future dep-bump release.
  - Version bump `0.6.0 → 0.7.0` in `package.json` (commit `dc800c2`).
  - Tag `v0.7.0` + push to origin (commit `dc800c2`).
  - `npm publish --ignore-scripts --access public` — succeeded; tarball 471 files / 563.9 KB / 2.1 MB unpacked. Registry: `0.5.1 → 0.7.0`.
  - GitHub release published at <https://github.com/danielsimonjr/universal-physics-tensor/releases/tag/v0.7.0> using the Option 1 body from `docs/architecture/v0.7-release-notes-draft.md`.

### Fixed at release gate (2026-05-25)

- **Windows backslash bug in v0.7.1 public-surface guard** (`tests/api/public-tag-vs-index-invariant.test.ts:318`, commit `c8ebdb1`). `node:path` `relative()` returns OS-native separators; the test's `^src\/` regex didn't match Windows backslash paths, falsely flagging `MathTSEngine` as unreachable from the public surface even though it is reachable via the `./numerical/mathts-engine` subpath export. Cross-platform failure mode: test would pass on Linux/macOS, fail on Windows — slipped past the original v0.7.1 sprint because that sprint's full-suite gate was run on a non-Windows env. Caught at the v0.7.0 release-gate run on Windows. One-line fix: normalize backslashes to forward slashes during path derivation. **Lesson**: release gates should be platform-matrix'd, not single-platform.
- **Stale `dist/` directory bypassed by `--ignore-scripts` publish workflow** (release prep, not a code commit). The Windows `--ignore-scripts` workaround for `prepublishOnly` (skipping the vitest cold-start tax) also silently skips the `tsc` build, so a stale `dist/` from an old build would ship verbatim. Caught at release prep: `dist/` contained 12 files / 67 KB of v0.1.0-era output while source had grown to bridges/dimensional/numerical/diff subsystems. Fix: explicit `rm -rf dist/ && npm run build` before publish (468 files / 3.1 MB fresh build). Not a recurring fix yet — future-resilient pattern would be splitting `prepublishOnly` into `prepack` (fast tsc, runs even with `--ignore-scripts` alternatives) + `prepublishOnly` (slow vitest gate).

---

## [0.6.1 — subsumed into 0.7.0]

Target tag: **v0.6.1** — Minimize / Simplify / Optimize sprint on top of v0.6.0, plus the rolled-up post-v0.6.0-tag maintenance work (bridge physics audit, doc-integrity review, vendored tooling, BE-33 fix, C-9 fix, 4-phase doc refresh, v0.7+ proposals doc) that was waiting in `[Unreleased]` for a tag. Six sprint phases on branch `claude/changelog-todo-sync-9PdMg`, suite preserved at **1675 passed / 0 failed / 1 skipped / 1 todo** (recovered from a 1672/5-failed master-HEAD state via Phase 0 cleanup). No new public-API surface. 24 internal-only exports removed — none had external importers (verified via grep across `src/`, `tests/`, `bench/`, `examples/`, `tools/`), so no downstream consumer is affected.

### Added

- **`src/dimensional/validator-registry.ts`** (Phase 2) — extracted from `validator.ts`'s `infer()` switch. The 11 curvature/GR-object arms (riemann-tensor, ricci-tensor, einstein-tensor, bianchi-residual, killing-vector, conserved-charge, stress-energy, cosmological-constant, einstein-equation, weyl-tensor, kretschmann-scalar) dispatch through a discriminated-union registry keyed on a three-pattern tag: (A) single-arg validator with freeIndices propagation; (B) two-arg validator with riemann-child closure, propagate freeIndices; (C) single-arg validator, scalar result, skip merge. The discriminated union forces every future GR-object addition to declare its pattern at compile-time, blocking the v0.5.0 ricci-slot-bug shape (silent miscompute from a "follow the pattern" arm with the wrong free-index policy).
- **`src/numerical/curvature-lowering-helpers.ts`** — two new exports `lowerBianchiResidual` + `lowerWeylTensor` (Phase 2). Extracted from `lowering.ts`'s `lowerCurvature` switch arms; each arm previously ran ~40-85 LOC of input-resolution + FD-pipeline + result-wrap boilerplate, now reduced to a single type-narrowed dispatch in `lowering.ts`.
- **`src/numerical/mathts-tensor.ambient.d.ts`** (Phase 0) — ambient module declaration for the optional peer `@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor`. Mirrors the v0.5.1 TS-4 precedent for `mathts-autograd.ambient.d.ts`. Closes the build-fails-without-peer gap caught at sprint baseline (`tsc` was failing at `src/numerical/engine-registry.ts:43` and `src/numerical/mathts-engine.ts:13` with TS2307 in environments without the sister-repo dep installed). Declares `Tensor` as a class with index-signature `any` members; real typing from `node_modules/@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor` takes precedence when the peer IS installed.
- **`bench/gl4-picard-alloc.bench.ts`** (Phase 5, PO-1) — Mercury-perihelion `solveGL4Stage` allocation diagnostic. Baseline at HEAD: 2,742 hz / 0.365 ms mean (single stage), 27.3 hz / 36.6 ms mean (100-stage batch). Per-stage cost is steady-state (single×100 ratio ≈ 100×).
- **`bench/ricci-lowering.bench.ts`** (Phase 5, PO-2) — Schwarzschild-fixture Riemann → Ricci pipeline diagnostic. Baseline at HEAD: Riemann-only 2,303 hz / 0.434 ms; full pipeline (Riemann + Ricci contraction) 2,331 hz / 0.429 ms. **Finding**: the Ricci contraction is essentially free vs the FD-Riemann assembly (1.01× ratio).
- **`bench/pderiv-grid.bench.ts`** (Phase 5, PD-grid) — Schwarzschild 3×3 grid sweep across order=2 vs order=4 centered stencils. Baseline at HEAD: order=2 20,244 hz / 1.36 μs per derivative call; order=4 8,388 hz / 3.31 μs per call. **Ratio**: order=4 is 2.41× slower than order=2 — favorable tradeoff for the ~10⁴× truncation-error reduction on smooth inputs that motivated the v0.6.0 default-order flip.
- **`docs/architecture/v0.6.1-baseline.md`** (Phase 0) — per-symbol export classification table (24 drops + 15 test-only + 30 public + 10 already-`@public`-tagged-no-importer); suite-count + dep-health baseline at master-HEAD vs v0.6.0 tag; explicit design-correction note for Phase 3 (the `--include-tests` flag did the wrong thing — empirically verified).
- **`docs/planning/v0.6.1-Design.md`** + **`docs/planning/v0.6.1-Review-Findings.md`** — sprint design doc + Adam+Eve adversarial-review findings (3 critical issues caught and reconciled before plan-drafting).
- **`docs/architecture/benchmarks.md`** — new "v0.6.1 baselines (PO-1 / PO-2 / PD-grid)" subsection capturing the three bench files' numbers + interpretation.
- **6 `@public` JSDoc tags** added at the declaration sites for symbols already re-exported by `src/index.ts` but missing the explicit marker: `BridgeEquationStatus` (`src/bridges/index.ts`), `Symmetry` and `InformationMeasure` (`src/core/types.ts`), `scale` (`src/dimensional/tensor.ts`), `Vec4` (`src/numerical/einstein-equation.ts`), `KillingEquationOptions` (`src/numerical/killing.ts`).
- **42-bridge physics-correctness audit** (`docs/architecture/BRIDGE-PHYSICS-AUDIT.md`, commit `1c77a1e`). Two-model review (Gemini 2.5 Pro + OpenAI o3) of every entry in the `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS` catalog with per-verdict honesty vetting and a deeper literature-grounded pass on contested findings. Headline: **0 INVALID verdicts** — no bridge equation is wrong physics. Systemic weakness is framing/metadata (unknown↔unknown bridge fields, status mis-calibration, bridge-incoherence), not the equations. The original dimensional-signature findings were RETRACTED after inspecting encoding modules — the audit had judged `dimensional_signature` against `formula_latex` while it actually describes the (reduced) encoded AST; §1 documents the retraction and reframes as a `formula_latex`↔encoding transparency gap. Ships with raw data: 84 model responses, prompts, categorizations, deeper-check transcript, and `FIX-SPEC.md`.
- **v0.6.0 documentation-integrity review** (`docs/architecture/v0.6.0-doc-integrity-review.md` + per-batch detail in `docs/architecture/doc-review/batch-{A..H}-findings.md`, commit `4c4cfb6`). 8-batch parallel review by an opus+sonnet agent team governed by the `rlm` skill (partition ~60 docs, aggregate without context rot) and `honest-claude` skill (grep-verify every claim, cite file:line, mark UNVERIFIED not guess). 63 reconciled findings (7 CRITICAL, 33 HIGH, 20 MEDIUM, 3 LOW). Honest headline: the v0.6.0 release work did NOT introduce doc hallucinations — Batch A (the 6 v0.6.0-cycle docs) found 0 critical, 0 fabrications. The real problem was accumulated *staleness* in long-lived current-state docs not refreshed across v0.4.6→v0.6.0 (README 6 releases stale; 5 architecture docs at v0.4.0; spec said 40 bridges vs actual 42; all 3 sub-READMEs omitted v0.6.0 additions). Agent-error rate 1.4% (vs 55% Eve-vet baseline) — the grep-verify-or-mark-UNVERIFIED discipline held.
- **`docs/planning/UPT v0.70 - Proposals.md`** (commit `b67481b`, 2026-05-22; renamed to add the `.md` extension in a follow-up commit). Architectural reframe for v0.7+ grounded in the MathTS CHANGELOG (rather than the earlier draft which assumed MathTS internals). Eight proposals: (1) Intelligent Index layer, (2) Sparse semantic catalog, (3) Typed L+B+E discriminated union, (4) Bridge DSL on `compileExpr`, (5) `RegimeType` extension system, (6) Bridge composition research track, (7) Bridge-as-workbook authoring via `.mtsw`, (8) Bridge parameter AD via `DualTensor`/`TapedTensor`. Honest framing in §0/§12: MathTS is *peer-level* to UPT, not a backend layer; nearly all v0.7 work happens inside the UPT repo consuming what MathTS already ships. Total non-research engineering: 11-16 weeks. Notes/proposals only — no commitments.
- **Vendored developer tooling under `tools/`** (commit `384db01`): `create-dependency-graph` (one-dep dep-graph generator, retrofitted to UPT), `plan-doc-audit` (zero-dep stub-aware plan-checkbox auditor, defaults to `docs/planning/`), `chunking-for-files` (large-file splitter/merger), `compress-for-context` (context compressor). Adds `tools/README.md` index, `.gitignore` entries for `tools/**/node_modules` + `tools/**/dist`, and two npm scripts: `docs:deps` (regenerate dep graph) + `audit:plans` (scan plan docs for unchecked checkboxes). All tools typecheck clean; root `npm run build` unaffected (tsconfig `rootDir:src` excludes `tools/`).

### Changed

- **`tools/create-dependency-graph/create-dependency-graph.ts`** (Phase 3) — two semantic improvements to the reachability analysis:
    - `detectUnused(files, testFiles?, exportsReachable?)` now accepts an optional test-files array and unions their imports into the importedFiles / importedSymbols sets. Eliminates the ~40 false-positive "unused" reports for `src/bridges/equations/be-NN-*.ts` modules (they're imported by per-bridge encoding tests, not by `src/bridges/index.ts`). The pre-existing `--include-tests` flag previously triggered a separate test-coverage report but did NOT feed `detectUnused` — Phase 0 caught this empirically.
    - New `resolveExportsReachable(pkg)` helper reverse-maps `package.json` `exports` subpaths (e.g. `"./numerical/mathts-engine"`) to their source paths (`src/numerical/mathts-engine.ts`) and marks them implicitly reachable. Eliminates the `mathts-engine.ts` false-positive (declared in `exports` but never re-exported via `src/index.ts`).
- **`package.json`** `scripts.docs:deps` — now passes `--include-tests` by default so the Phase 3 reachability fix is active without remembering the flag.
- **`src/dimensional/validator.ts`** — 816 → 715 LOC (-101). The 11-arm curvature/GR-object dispatch consolidated into a single fall-through `case` that delegates to `validator-registry.ts`. Pure refactor — no behavioral change; existing `tests/dimensional/*` cover all 11 kinds.
- **`src/numerical/lowering.ts`** — 1015 → 903 LOC (-112). The `bianchi-residual` and `weyl-tensor` arms shrank from ~40 / ~85 LOC each to one-line type-narrowed dispatches.
- **`src/numerical/curvature-lowering-helpers.ts`** — 579 → 737 LOC (+158, absorbs the two extracted arm bodies + three tiny file-private utility helpers `_dimensionOf`, `_requireValue`, `_flattenNestedArray` that mirror their lowering.ts counterparts).
- **`docs/specification/Part-II.md`** BE-33 block (Phase 0) — added the "Corrected on 2026-05-20 (commit `394d164`, bridge physics audit)" marker the spec-vs-index test asserts must be present alongside the index's notes block; updated the mathematical-formulation image + alt-text to the corrected `−1/z` form.
- **`tests/dimensional/part-viii-spec-vs-impl.test.ts`** (Phase 0) — relaxed the stale `/^0\.5\./` package-version pin to `/^0\./` (TENSOR-RULE: v030-additive-semver-minor-bump intent is pre-1.0 additive-semver, not specifically the 0.5.x line).
- **`tests/bridges/be-33-reformulation.test.ts`** (Phase 0) — `formula_latex` assertion inverted to match the 2026-05-20 BE-33 correction: now asserts the `−1/z` form is present AND the `ν` symbol is absent (ν-independence regression guard).
- **`tests/numerical/engine-conformance.mathts.test.ts`** + **`tests/numerical/mathts-engine-typing.test.ts`** (Phase 0) — added `describe.skip-when-optional-dep-absent` gating consistent with the pattern at `tests/numerical/engine-conformance.test.ts:20`. Without the gating, missing the optional peer `@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor` caused the test file itself to fail to load (0 tests counted), masking suite state.
- **`package-lock.json`** (Phase 0) — resynced from `version: 0.1.0` (stale) to `version: 0.6.0`; added the `optionalDependencies` entries that landed in `package.json` somewhere between v0.4.x and v0.6.0 but were never reflected in the lockfile. Unblocks `npm ci`.
- **`docs/architecture/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`** + **`dependency-graph.{json,yaml}`** + **`unused-analysis.md`** + **`TEST_COVERAGE.md`** — regenerated at sprint-final HEAD reflecting Phase 1/2/3 changes. Unused-files count went 44 → 2 (both intentional ambient `.d.ts`); unused-exports count went 79 → 101 (higher-resolution analysis, see Internal section below).

### Removed (Internal-only)

24 symbols (no external importers anywhere — verified per-symbol in Phase 0) had their `export` keyword dropped. Bodies retained as file-local where internal callers exist; `FlatMatrix` deleted entirely (zero internal callers).

| File | Symbols dropped |
|---|---|
| `src/bridges/index.ts` | `BridgeTractabilityClass` |
| `src/dimensional/connection-validators.ts` | `CovariantDerivativeValidationResult`, `RiemannTensorValidationResult` |
| `src/dimensional/killing-validators.ts` | `KillingVectorValidationResult`, `ConservedChargeValidationResult` |
| `src/dimensional/stress-energy-validators.ts` | `StressEnergyValidationResult`, `CosmologicalConstantValidationResult` |
| `src/dimensional/weyl-validators.ts` | `WeylTensorValidationResult` |
| `src/dimensional/tensor.ts` | `TensorSymbolValidationResult`, `ContractionResult`, `TensorExprNode` |
| `src/dimensional/validator.ts` | Re-export of `TensorExprNode` removed (the union had no downstream consumer). |
| `src/numerical/curvature-lowering-helpers.ts` | `outerStep`, `riemannUpperAt`, `lowerFirstIndex`, `dRiemannLowerAt`, `FlatMatrix` (deleted), `DGammaTensor`, `GammaTensor` |
| `src/numerical/gl4-integrator.ts` | `StageSolveResult` |
| `src/numerical/lowering.ts` | `buildEinsumSpec` |
| `src/numerical/null-ray-integrator.ts` | `ODESystem` |
| `src/numerical/pderiv.ts` | `PderivOptions` |
| `src/numerical/tensor-engine.ts` | `EinsumFreeAxis` (the `isEinsumSpec` predicate is test-imported and stays exported) |
| `src/numerical/weyl-lowering.ts` | `WeylInputs` |

### Fixed

- **BE-33 Hertz-Millis finite-temperature correlation-length exponent corrected: `−ν/z` → `−1/z`** (commit `394d164`). The encoded scaling `ξ_quantum(T) ~ ξ₀(T/T₀)^(−ν/z)` conflated the two axes of quantum-critical scaling. At a quantum critical point the *temperature* dependence of the spatial correlation length is set by the dynamic exponent `z` alone — `ξ ~ T^(−1/z)` — because temperature fixes the thermal length `L_T ~ T^(−1/z)`; the correlation-length exponent `ν` governs the separate *T=0 tuning-parameter* divergence `ξ ~ |g−g_c|^(−ν)` and cancels out of the scaling function at the critical coupling. Confirmed by a literature check against the QCP-scaling reviews (`cond-mat/0503298` states `ξ ~ (T/Tc)^(−1/z)` explicitly; Hertz 1976; Millis 1993). Changed: the AST exponent pin (`−0.71` → `−1`), `evaluateHertzMillis` (now computes `−1/z`; the `nu` input is retained for API stability and is still validated, but no longer affects the result — a future breaking cleanup may remove it), `formula_latex`, the Millis-1993 reference annotation, and `tests/bridges/be-33-encoding.test.ts` (the universality-class-dependent bracket test replaced with a `z`-dependence test and a `ν`-independence regression guard). The dimensional-signature round-trip is unaffected (a dimensionless ratio raised to any exponent stays dimensionless). A second `known_issue` was added flagging that the entry's "Hertz-Millis / 3D Heisenberg, z=1, ν≈0.71" universality-class label is itself questionable — canonical *itinerant* Hertz-Millis sits above its upper critical dimension with mean-field exponents (z=2 AFM / z=3 FM). Source: bridge physics audit, `docs/architecture/BRIDGE-PHYSICS-AUDIT.md` §2/§4.
- **C-9 dep-graph generator bug** (in-tree fix via the vendored `tools/create-dependency-graph/`, commit `384db01`). Source-comment text inside multi-line `export { ... } from` blocks was leaking into re-export symbol rows of `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`; added `stripBraceBlockComments` + `splitBraceSymbols` so comments are stripped while `type X` re-exports are preserved.
- **5 pre-existing master-HEAD test failures** that predate the sprint (Phase 0 cleanup, commit `0da412f`): two `mathts-engine` test files failing to LOAD due to missing optional peer + no skip-gating; stale `/^0\.5\./` package-version pin (TENSOR-RULE v030-additive-semver-minor-bump); BE-33 reformulation test asserting `ν/z` form after the 2026-05-20 fix removed it; missing "Corrected on 2026-05-20" marker in `docs/specification/Part-II.md`. Plus the lockfile resync. **Suite went 1672 / 5-failed → 1675 / 0-failed before any Phase 1+ work**.
- **Build broken without optional peer** (`tsc` TS2307 at `engine-registry.ts:43` + `mathts-engine.ts:13`) — closed by the new `mathts-tensor.ambient.d.ts`.

### Docs

- **Phase 1 — current-state corrections** (commit `da43627`): README/CHANGELOG/CLAUDE.md/bridges-README brought from "Current Version: v0.4.5" / "40 bridges" up to v0.6.0 / 42 bridges baseline.
- **Phase 2 — architecture-doc refresh** (commit `50aa5b1`): C-1..C-24 findings — `API.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `COMPONENTS.md`, `DATAFLOW.md`, `OVERVIEW.md`, `TEST_COVERAGE.md`, `benchmarks.md`, `unused-analysis.md` advanced from v0.4.0 stamps through v0.6.0 (curvature layer added, `CurvatureCompositeNode` factory documented as extracted, stale "do not extract" guidance removed).
- **Phase 3 — spec + sub-README staleness** (commit `fe6d51f`): D-1..D-8 (Part-II BE-37 rewritten Shapiro-delay; BE-36 GW170817 graviton-speed bound promoted to mathematical formulation; spec-scope notes on IDs 11–50 vs codebase-only IDs 51–52; Part-IV §12.2.1/14.1.3 reconciled; AST-grammar 21-kind union acknowledged), E-1..E-5 (Part-VII/VIII forward-pointer notes, dim-refactor deferral acknowledged, `RepeatedDummyLabelError` → `DuplicateIndexLabelError`, v0.3.0 module count, "revisited" pointer), F-3..F-8 (sub-READMEs: `src/bridges/README.md`, `src/dimensional/README.md`, `bench/README.md` all advanced through v0.6.0).
- **Phase 4 — historical banners + arithmetic + v0.6.0 cycle notes** (commit `b814a71`): G-1..G-4 (Tier-5 yes-ready bucket label 7→8; BE-37 SUPERSEDED banner; BE-40 re-bucketed R5→R2 in Bridge-Remediation-Plan; v0.4.0-Review-Findings showstoppers 5→6 with S5 Eve-only note), H-1..H-4 (refactor/minimize-targets counts, severity-row alignment, audit PD-delta correction), A-1..A-5 (pc-1.5 finding sections prefixed "Hypothesis (bench output pending):" — predictions not measurements; v0.6.0-Design/Plan post-cycle notes acknowledging GL4 + computeChristoffelTensor do NOT consume `christoffelFn` (BR-2 touched only the RK4 path); E-5 ν-major race not run, λ-major adopted directly; Task 4.4 count gate softened to actual 1693 baseline).
- **CLAUDE.md** (Phase 4) — removed the `.ruff_cache (stale)` mention (directory no longer exists); updated "Current release state" block to v0.6.1-prep posture. Bridge-status distribution (8 established / 31 speculative / 3 highly-speculative / 0 invalid) verified UNCHANGED at HEAD — no re-tally needed.

### Internal — sprint metadata

- **Phase architecture**: six phases in explicit order 0 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 5 → 4 (Phase 0 baseline + cleanup; Phase 3 tooling fix first so Phase 1 metric drop is cleanly attributable; Phase 4 doc refresh last so it reflects final state). 21 sprint commits.
- **LOC delta**: net source LOC reduction across `validator.ts` + `lowering.ts` is **-213 LOC**; `curvature-lowering-helpers.ts` absorbed +158 LOC; new `validator-registry.ts` is 174 LOC. **Net total: +119 LOC** for substantially better factor structure (the registry's discriminated union is the load-bearing piece — adding a new GR-object node-kind is now a compile-time decision).
- **Adam+Eve adversarial review** ran on the design doc per Decision #9, using the v0.5.1 carry-forward "Opus subagent fallback" pattern (no `llm-gemini`/`llm-openai` MCPs in this remote-execution environment). Three critical findings caught + reconciled before plan-drafting and before any code changed:
    - **S1 (HIGH)** — test-imported symbols were misclassified as "internal-only" in the original recon. Verified via grep: `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`, `GL4_C/A/B`, `riemannLowerAt`, `covariantDerivRiemannLowerAt` all test-imported. Dropping `export` would have broken the build. Fix: four-bucket policy with a new (a') bucket = "test-only importer, keep `export` + `@internal`".
    - **S2 (HIGH)** — the validator-registry pattern claim ("10 arms, identical pattern") was wrong. Actually **11 arms across 3 patterns**: three pass a riemann-child closure (ricci/einstein/bianchi), three are scalar and skip freeIndices merge (conserved-charge/cosmological-constant/kretschmann-scalar), five are standard. Same shape as the v0.5.0 ricci-slot bug. Fix: discriminated-union registry contract on `pattern: 'A' | 'B' | 'C'` with exhaustive typecheck.
    - **S3 (HIGH)** — Track-C premise was wrong. The BE-equation modules are NOT imported by `src/bridges/index.ts` (only referenced as prose inside `notes:` string-literals). The `--include-tests` flag existed but triggered a coverage report; it did NOT feed `detectUnused`. Fix: extended `detectUnused(files, testFiles?)` to consume test imports.

  Eve fabrication rate: **1/13** (E-R10 was a speculative claim about `tools/plan-doc-audit/` importing from `src/`; verified false). Much better than v0.5.1's 5/9 baseline. Adam verified-arithmetic errors caught (V1/V2/V6/V9/V10) all confirmed by file-counting. Full reconciliation: `docs/planning/v0.6.1-Review-Findings.md`.

- **Per-symbol export classification**: 79 unused exports at sprint baseline classified into four buckets — (a) UNUSED no `@public` → drop export (24 symbols); (a') test-only importer → keep export, no action (15 symbols, now naturally hidden after Phase 3); (b-orphan) `@public`-tagged with no current importer → no action (10 symbols, intentional surface); (b) re-exported by `src/index.ts` → add `@public` if missing (6 added, 15 already had it); plus 9 parser-misses inspected manually. Detail in `docs/architecture/v0.6.1-baseline.md`.

### Dependency health

- `npm audit`: **0 vulnerabilities** (unchanged from v0.6.0 release gate).
- `npm outdated`: dev-deps only — `@types/node` 24.12.2→24.12.4 (patch available) / 25.x (major available, deferred from v0.6.0); `vitest` 4.1.4→4.1.7 (patch, deferred from v0.6.0); `typescript` 5.9.3 → 6.0.3 (major, deferred from v0.6.0). No HIGH/CRITICAL findings; all deferred as non-blocking per v0.6.1's "hygiene only, no upgrades" scope.

### Metrics

| Measure | v0.6.0 tag | master HEAD pre-sprint | v0.6.1 sprint-final |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Tests passed | 1693 | 1672 | **1675** |
| Tests failed | 0 | 3 | **0** |
| Test files failing to load | 0 | 2 | **0** (gated when optional dep absent) |
| Tests skipped | 1 | 1 | **1** |
| Unused exports (dep-graph) | 79 | 79 | **101** ✱ |
| Unused files (dep-graph) | 44 | 44 | **2** ✱✱ |
| `src/numerical/lowering.ts` LOC | 1015 | 1015 | **903** |
| `src/dimensional/validator.ts` LOC | 816 | 816 | **715** |
| `npm audit` HIGH/CRITICAL | 0 | 0 | **0** |

✱ The export count went UP because Phase 3's `detectUnused` fix surfaced previously-file-unused BE-equation module internals (`*_LHS` constants, `validate*Dimensions` functions) for individual accounting. Higher-resolution measurement, not regression. The 24 Phase-1 drops dropped out cleanly.

✱✱ The 2 remaining "unused" files are `src/numerical/mathts-autograd.ambient.d.ts` + `src/numerical/mathts-tensor.ambient.d.ts` — both intentional ambient `.d.ts` files consumed globally by tsc rather than via explicit `import`.

### Still pending

- **v0.6.0 npm publish remains BLOCKED** on expired `NPM_TOKEN`. Registry still shows `0.5.1`; tag `v0.6.0` at `ac0cf06` and the upcoming `v0.6.1` will both publish cleanly once the token is rotated. User action — see `todo.md` Active queue.
- **v0.6.1 tag** — sprint is code-complete on branch `claude/changelog-todo-sync-9PdMg`; pending user action: bump `package.json` 0.6.0 → 0.6.1, commit + tag `v0.6.1` + merge to master + push.
- **GitHub release notes for v0.6.0 + v0.6.1** — to be drafted from this `[Unreleased]` block once npm publish lands (or independently).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-20

v0.6.0 is the "Einstein field equation closure + curvature classification + Shapiro investigation" release. 36 tasks across 4 phases. Phase 1 delivered the Killing-vector conserved-charge machinery (`KillingVectorNode`, `ConservedChargeNode`, `verifyKillingEquation`, `evaluateConservedCharge`) — the first structural encoding of a continuous symmetry and its Noether charge on the UPT tensor. Phase 2 closed the long-standing gap that BE-17's docstring documented as impossible: the Einstein field equation is now structurally encodable via `StressEnergyTensorNode`, `CosmologicalConstantNode`, `EinsteinFieldEquationNode`, and `validateEinsteinFieldEquation` / `evaluateEinsteinEquationResidual`, enabling matter-coupled G_μν = κ T_μν encoding alongside the vacuum case shipped in v0.5.0. Phase 3 completed the curvature-classification surface with `WeylTensorNode`, `KretschmannScalarNode`, `computeKretschmann`, and the `CurvatureCompositeNode<K,S>` factory extracted from the now-five-instance curvature pattern — the PD-6 trigger that had been deferred since v0.5.0 fired when Weyl arrived as the 5th curvature primitive. `CURVATURE_KIND_REGISTRY` provides introspection across all curvature node kinds. Phase 4 was release-prep: BR-2 `christoffelFn` flat-array refactor (BREAKING, 5-6× RK4 speedup), `pderivNumericalFn` default order flip 2→4 (FD-flip), JSDoc backfill, bridge re-encoding audit, and PC-1.5 Shapiro investigation closure.

### Added

- `KillingVectorNode` AST kind + `ConservedChargeNode` AST kind — first structural encoding of continuous symmetries and their Noether charges on the UPT tensor. `evaluateConservedCharge` numerical evaluator. `verifyKillingEquation` checks the Killing equation `∇_μ ξ_ν + ∇_ν ξ_μ = 0` numerically.
- `StressEnergyTensorNode`, `CosmologicalConstantNode`, `EinsteinFieldEquationNode` — closes the structural-encoding gap documented in BE-17's docstring ("cannot be encoded"). `validateEinsteinFieldEquation` and `evaluateEinsteinEquationResidual` for matter-coupled and vacuum cases.
- `WeylTensorNode` + `KretschmannScalarNode` + `computeKretschmann` — completes the curvature-classification surface (Riemann → Ricci → Einstein → Bianchi → Weyl/Kretschmann).
- `CurvatureCompositeNode<K,S>` factory + `CURVATURE_KIND_REGISTRY` — extracted from the five-instance curvature pattern; PD-6 extraction trigger fired on Weyl as 5th curvature primitive.
- `christoffelFnFlat` — `Float64Array(64)` flat variant (λ-major `16λ+4μ+ν` encoding) for callers that want maximum allocation efficiency without the BR-2 breaking change on the legacy nested-array path (both surfaces exported during transition).
- New fixtures: Schwarzschild Killing vectors (t-translation + φ-rotation conservation), perfect-fluid stress-energy, de Sitter cosmological-constant, FLRW.
- PC-1.5 investigation finding document: `docs/architecture/pc-1.5-shapiro-residual-floor.md`.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **`christoffelFn` / `schwarzschildChristoffelFn` now return `Float64Array(64)` (λ-major `16λ+4μ+ν` encoding) instead of nested `number[4][4][4]`.** BR-2 carry-forward from v0.5.1. Verified bit-identical on all existing bridge and fixture tests; RK4/GL4 integrator measured **5-6× faster** (eliminates ~160k nested-array allocations per 10k-step geodesic call). Callers that indexed into `christoffel[λ][μ][ν]` must migrate to `christoffel[16*λ + 4*μ + ν]`.
- **`pderivNumericalFn` default `order` flipped `2 → 4`** (FD-flip). The 4th-order centered stencil `(−f(x+2h)+8f(x+h)−8f(x−h)+f(x−2h))/(12h)` is now the default; callers that relied on `order: 2` behavior must pass `{ order: 2 }` explicitly. Motivation: the c²·g_tt ≈ 6e16 scale on SI Schwarzschild metrics causes catastrophic cancellation at 2nd-order; every new curvature consumer is safer with 4th-order as the default. Truncation error ~10⁴× lower on smooth inputs.

### Honest framing

- **PC-1.5 investigation (Decision #8: measure-and-document, not measure-and-fix)**: Phase 1 established via bit-exact Killing-charge conservation that the BE-37 Shapiro residual (2.51e-4) is NOT integrator-drift-driven — conserved charges are bit-stable across 10k-step geodesic runs. Remaining suspects are null-IC reconstruction noise (sqrt + sign-choice ~5e-15 absolute accumulating over 1500s coord-time) and affine-parameter mismatch between geodesic and closed-form evaluator conventions. The integrator was cleared as a suspect. See `docs/architecture/pc-1.5-shapiro-residual-floor.md`. Full remediation (null-IC noise sweep + affine-parameter axis) deferred per Decision #8.
- **Bridge re-encoding (Task 4.3)**: Only BE-20 had a genuine v0.6.0 re-encoding (`CosmologicalConstantNode`). BE-13, BE-17, BE-19, BE-39, and BE-50 were assessed and honestly NOT re-encoded — no applicable new primitive maps to their encoded forms. BE-17's "cannot be encoded" docstring claim was corrected (the claim was false post-v0.6.0). Per Decision #9, NO bridge status pins were promoted from `speculative` → `established`: structural encoding is necessary but not sufficient for a status upgrade; observational/experimental grounding must be established independently.

### Adam+Eve adversarial review

- Design vet: 12 findings reconciled, 1 Eve hallucination rejected (Weyl tensor prefactor — Eve fabricated a specific literature value with high confidence; grep-verification found no such source). See `docs/planning/v0.6.0-Review-Findings.md`.
- Plan vet: 13 findings reconciled, 2 Eve hallucinations rejected. See `docs/planning/v0.6.0-Plan-Review-Findings.md`.

### Dependency health

- `npm audit`: **0 vulnerabilities**.
- `npm outdated`: dev-deps only — `@types/node` 24.12.2→24.12.4 (patch available) / 25.x (major available, deferred); `vitest` 4.1.4→4.1.7 (patch, deferred); `typescript` 5.9.3 / 6.x major available (deferred). No HIGH/CRITICAL findings; all deferred as non-blocking.

Suite: 1595 (v0.5.1) → **1693 passed** (+98 net new tests counting the pre-existing-fix delta), 179 files, 1 skip + 1 todo (both pre-existing).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-05-19

Stability / hygiene patch on top of v0.5.0's GR foundations release. Constants canonicalization (new `src/core/constants.ts` flat exports — `PhysicalConstants` namespace retained for backwards-compat); diagnostic-warning propagation through the curvature pipeline (`scanForMetricPair` now walks v0.5.0 curvature node kinds); backfilled test coverage on heaviest v0.5.0 additions (connection-validators ~250 LOC per-throw, fresh-label, flat-Minkowski curvature zero-tests, real Mercury N-orbit Picard convergence); type-safety hardening on `bianchiResidual` public surface (6× `any` → `import type`); algorithmic dedup (contractRiemannJS helper extracted from Ricci/Einstein arms; makeSchwarzschildContext helper extracted from 5 fixture closures); `pderiv.ts` opt-in 4th-order centered stencil; 7 zombie `it.todo` markers retired; 5 doc-vs-code skews fixed (LC-1 RicciTensorNode JSDoc per Carroll Eq. 3.91, LC-3 engine-registry version literal, LC-4 connection-validators Part-IX qualifier, LC-7 einstein() JSDoc, LC-8 null-ray-integrator module description); v0.5.0 plan annotated with post-S1 Ricci-slot addendum.

**Honest framing**: PC-1 hypothesis (audit prediction that `c_SI` drift dominates BE-37 Shapiro residual) was empirically **REFUTED** — residual stayed at 2.51e-4 after both BE-37 and fixture migrations; the actual residual floor is integrator-driven (GL4 step count or null-IC reconstruction). Constants canonicalization is still net-positive hygiene (single source of truth) but does NOT improve numerical results as predicted. Investigation deferred to v0.5.2 / v0.6.0 ("PC-1.5" — see `docs/planning/v0.6.0-Brainstorm.md`).

**Adam+Eve adversarial vetting** was performed on the audit phase only (`docs/architecture/v0.5.1-audit.md` reconciliation section); Adam=Gemini 2.5 Pro caught 5 net-new findings + 1 severity bump; Eve=OpenAI o3 fabricated 5/9 challenges (memory: `feedback_eve_o3_hallucinations.md`). Design and plan adversarial vets pending MCP availability — will land as follow-up commits.

**BR-2 deferred** to v0.6.0 (christoffelFn nested-array → Float64Array(64), breaking).

### Detailed change list

### Added
- `GL4Options.onStep` — opt-in per-step diagnostics callback receiving
  `{step, iterations, halvings}`. Fires once per successful integrator
  step; lets gated long-run tests (and external tooling) measure Picard
  convergence statistics without changing the integrator's primary
  return shape. Used by the new gated `GL4_LONG=1` Mercury N-orbit
  Picard-convergence test in `tests/numerical/gl4-integrator.test.ts`,
  which replaces the v0.5.0 `expect(true).toBe(true)` stub with a real
  IC computation (vis-viva L + Legendre-transform E at perihelion) and
  asserts `failureFraction = steps_with_halving / steps < 0.001`.
  Default orbit count: 20 (~1M steps, ~6 min wall clock); release-prep
  100-orbit run via `GL4_LONG_ORBITS=100 GL4_LONG=1`. Gated path not
  exercised in commit (default `it.skip`); release-prep gates this for
  manual run. PD-4.
- `tests/dimensional/minkowski-curvature.test.ts` — flat-spacetime
  zero-tests on the entire v0.5.0 curvature pipeline (5 tests). All
  curvature objects (R^ρ_{σμν}, R_μν, G_μν, R-scalar, Bianchi residual
  max) must be identically zero (≤1e-12 machine-precision) on a flat
  Minkowski metric. Adam's miss-case finding — every prior curvature test
  lives on a curved fixture where FD truncation hides convention bugs.
  Uses a new unitless (c=1) Minkowski variant in
  `tests/fixtures/minkowski.ts` (rescaling-invariance same precedent as
  `unitlessSchwarzschildGFn` in the Bianchi-residual test; SI variant
  also exported for non-curvature consumers) (NEW-1).
- Unit coverage for `freshLabel` (Part-VIII §VIII.5 TENSOR-RULE
  raise-lower-fresh-label-deterministic). 6 new tests in
  `tests/dimensional/fresh-label.test.ts` pinning: always-suffixed
  `<base>_1`, increment-on-collision, determinism, unicode base,
  high-counter gap skip-down (UC-2).
- Per-function unit coverage on `src/dimensional/connection-validators.ts`
  (~250 LOC, heaviest v0.5.0 critical-path validator). 11 new tests in
  `tests/dimensional/connection-validators.test.ts` covering every
  `validateCovariantDerivative` + `validateRiemannTensor` throw path plus
  happy path (UC-1).
- `pderivNumericalFn` now accepts a `PderivOptions` parameter with
  `order?: 2 | 4` (default `2`, opt-in `4`) and `h?: number` explicit step
  override. `order: 4` activates the 4-point centered stencil
  `(−f(x+2h) + 8 f(x+h) − 8 f(x−h) + f(x−2h)) / (12 h)` with adaptive step
  `h = 1e-4·max(|x|,1)` (the regime where the O(h⁴) truncation advantage
  materialises vs round-off on smooth inputs). `order: 2` preserves the
  v0.3.5 default `h = 1e-6·max(|x|,1)` for backwards compat. The `h`
  override is load-bearing for `curvature-lowering-helpers.ts`'s inner ∂g
  sampler (1e-3 step to balance c²·g_tt cancellation noise). PD-7.

### Removed
- 7 zombie `it.todo` markers referencing shipped milestones (PD-9 / UC-5 /
  AS-5): two `v0.4.0` Christoffel/covariant-derivative todos from
  `covariant-derivative-preview.test.ts` (both shipped in v0.4.0); three
  `v0.3.0–v0.3.5` storage-order / dimension-uniformity / pderiv-preview
  todos from `tensor-symbol.test.ts` (all shipped); and the entire
  `inverse-metric-consistency.test.ts` file (two v0.3.5 todos — the
  `InverseMetricInconsistencyWarning` they referenced ships in
  `src/dimensional/validator.ts` `scanForMetricPair` and is actively
  tested in `tests/numerical/metric-inverse{,-curvature-walk}.test.ts`).
  The legitimate `it.todo` at `tests/bridges/catalog-integrity.test.ts:137`
  (BE-42 Hawking-temperature, no geodesic content yet) is preserved.

### Changed
- `docs/planning/v0.6.0-Brainstorm.md` — seeded v0.6.0 brainstorm doc
  capturing v0.5.1 carry-forward items: BR-2 `christoffelFn`
  flat-`Float64Array(64)` return shape (breaking; 2–3× RK4/GL4 speedup),
  PD-6 curvature-layer extraction triggers (Weyl/Kretschmann/Bianchi-2nd-
  form/Riemann–Cartan torsion piece), deferred performance items
  PO-2/PO-3, NEW-3 JSDoc polish, and the v0.5.1 empirical finding that
  the PC-1 hypothesis was **REFUTED** — BE-37 Shapiro residual stayed
  at 2.51e-4 post-constants-migration, identifying integrator-driven
  causes (GL4 step count, null-IC reconstruction) as the new
  PC-1.5 investigation target for v0.5.2 or v0.6.0. BR-2.
- `tests/dimensional/duplicate-coord-warning.test.ts` and
  `tests/dimensional/covariant-derivative-node.test.ts` — the
  `UPT_ALLOW_COORD_SHADOW=1` paths previously installed a forwarding
  `process.emitWarning` wrapper that captured `DuplicateCoordinateWarning`
  AND forwarded to the original emitter, surfacing the (intentional)
  warning to stderr during the test run. Migrated to
  `vi.spyOn(process, 'emitWarning').mockImplementation(() => {})` so the
  spy captures call args for assertions but the warning does not surface
  to stderr. Behavior under test unchanged; suite stderr cleaner. PD-8.
- `src/numerical/gl4-integrator.ts` — `GL4_C`, `GL4_A`, `GL4_B`
  Butcher-tableau constants retagged from `@public` to `@internal` in
  their JSDoc. They remain `export`s (test files import them to pin
  invariants), but the JSDoc taxonomy now correctly reflects that they
  are test-only knobs — public callers should use `integrateGeodesicGL4`.
  `solveGL4Stage` and `StageSolveResult` were already `@internal` per
  v0.5.0. UC-3.
- `CLAUDE.md` Repo invariants — added release pre-flight checklist:
  run `npm audit` and `npm outdated` before `npm publish`; address any
  HIGH/CRITICAL audit findings before tagging; document the dep-health
  snapshot in CHANGELOG. v0.5.1 snapshot (this release): `npm audit` =
  **0 vulnerabilities**; `npm outdated` = 4 entries — `@types/node`
  24.12.2 → 25.9.0 (major, dev only), `typescript` 5.9.3 → 6.0.3 (major,
  dev only), `vitest` 4.1.4 → 4.1.6 (patch), `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd`
  MISSING / 0.1.0 (optional peer, expected; auto-install gated). No
  HIGH/CRITICAL action required. NEW-5.
- `docs/architecture/COMPONENTS.md` — added "Curvature layer pattern
  (v0.5.0)" section documenting the four-instance composite-AST pattern
  (Riemann/Ricci/Einstein/Bianchi), the proposed
  `CurvatureCompositeNode<K, S>` extraction shape, and the explicit
  extraction trigger (5th curvature primitive — Weyl tensor, Kretschmann
  scalar, Bianchi-2nd-form, or Riemann–Cartan torsion piece). Premature
  abstraction risk dominates marginal LOC savings while v0.5.0's
  curvature surface is the only consumer (PD-6).
- `tests/fixtures/schwarzschild.ts` — extracted module-private
  `makeSchwarzschildContext(M_kg, x)` helper consumed by all five fixture
  closures (`schwarzschildChristoffelFn`, `schwarzschildGFn`,
  `schwarzschildGInverseFn`, `schwarzschildDgInverseFn`,
  `schwarzschildRiemannFn`). Pre-evaluates `r_s = 2GM/c²`, `r`, `θ`,
  `sinθ`, `cosθ`, `sin²θ`, `f = 1 − r_s/r` once per call. Eliminates the
  six-line opening boilerplate duplicated across the five closures
  (~30 LOC). Fixture public API unchanged; all 10 fixture-consumer test
  files remain green at v0.5.0 tolerances. AS-2.
- `src/numerical/lowering.ts` ricci-tensor arm: the hand-rolled
  4-axis-flat → 2-axis JS contraction is now delegated to a new
  `contractRiemannJS(flatR, N, {upperAxis, lowerAxis, outAxes})` helper
  in `src/numerical/curvature-lowering-helpers.ts`. The Einstein arm
  benefits transitively (it lowers its inner Ricci through the same
  case). Tolerances unchanged: Schwarzschild vacuum Ricci ≤5e-9 normalized
  per component; de Sitter R-scalar identity to ≤1e-14; Einstein
  G_μν + Λ g_μν ≤1e-10 relErr; trace identity g^μν G_μν = −R to
  ≤1e-14; Bianchi residual vacuum ≤1e-6. AS-1.
- `src/numerical/curvature-lowering-helpers.ts` migrated: the three
  hand-coded 4th-order stencils (`makeInnerGradFn`, `dGammaAt` outer FD,
  `dRiemannLowerAt` outer FD) now delegate to the shared
  `pderivNumericalFn(..., {order: 4})` rather than each rolling their own
  ±h, ±2h evaluation + flatten + `(−f₊₂ + 8 f₊₁ − 8 f₋₁ + f₋₂)/(12 h)`
  loop. Net effect: −44 LOC in the curvature helper, one canonical
  4th-order code path, identical numerical output. Riemann-lowering
  ≤1e-9 relErr gate verified post-migration on Schwarzschild
  (`tests/numerical/riemann-tensor-lowering.test.ts`). PD-7.

### Fixed
- `InverseMetricInconsistencyWarning` now fires for inconsistent metric pairs
  inside `covariant-derivative`, `riemann-tensor`, `ricci-tensor`,
  `einstein-tensor`, `bianchi-residual` AST nodes (PC-3). Previously silent on
  the entire v0.4.0+v0.5.0 GR pipeline — `scanForMetricPair` only walked the
  pre-curvature `op`/`tensor-product`/`integral`/`derivative`/
  `tensor-partial-derivative` arms, so every curvature node was a black box to
  the diagnostic. Adam's severity upgrade post-vet (MEDIUM → HIGH) flagged
  this as "a validation mechanism that doesn't run is worse than no validation
  at all." Future-extensibility comment added to the walker; v0.6.0+ curvature
  kinds need explicit arms. v0.5.1 Task 6.

### Refactored
- `tests/fixtures/schwarzschild.ts` migrated from local `G_SI = 6.6743e-11; c_SI = 2.998e8;`
  literals to `import { C_SI as c_SI, G_SI } from '../../src/core/constants.js';`.
  Three downstream test files (`tests/fixtures/schwarzschild.test.ts`,
  `tests/numerical/gl4-integrator.test.ts`,
  `tests/numerical/schwarzschild-radial-geodesic.test.ts`) also migrated:
  each held its OWN local `c = 2.998e8` literal driving the analytic
  cycloid / `r_s` baseline. When only the fixture canonicalized, the
  baselines drifted relative to the integrator's `r_s` and the cycloid
  relErr blew from ~8×10⁻¹⁶ to ~3.4×10⁻⁶ (escalation triggered per plan
  Step 4). Migrating these three consumers restored machine precision —
  empirical cycloid relErr post-canonicalization = **2.94×10⁻¹⁵** at 5000
  GL4 steps (well under the 1×10⁻¹³ gate). **Honest plan deviation**:
  Phase 1 Task 4 spec assumed fixture-only migration; the three consumer
  test files needed in-the-same-commit migration. Also restores
  `tests/bridges/perihelion-precession.test.ts` 1e-12 bridge-vs-local
  cross-check gate (was relaxed to 1e-4 in v0.5.1 Task 2's transitional
  window). **PC-1 second-leg discriminator**: BE-37 covariant-eikonal
  Shapiro relErr **= 2.51×10⁻⁴ post-Task-4 — identical to post-Task-1**.
  Task 1's hypothesis that the fixture's truncated c was the remaining
  dominant contributor is therefore ALSO refuted; the residual floor is
  GL4 step-count / null-IC reconstruction, not constants drift. v0.5.1
  Task 4.

### Changed
- `src/bridges/gravitational-lensing.ts` (BE-51) and `src/bridges/perihelion-precession.ts`
  (BE-52) migrated from local `const G_SI = 6.6743e-11; const c_SI = 2.998e8;`
  literals to `import { C_SI as c_SI, G_SI } from '../core/constants.js';`.
  Renamed via import alias (`C_SI as c_SI`) so the algebraic bodies (which
  use lower-case `c_SI` to match the formula notation) remain untouched.
  BE-52 Mercury one-orbit precession relErr **unchanged at 1.77×10⁻⁷**
  (v0.5.0 baseline) — Mercury isn't impact-parameter-grazing geometry where
  the c² drift matters most, as predicted. **Transitional window note**:
  `tests/bridges/perihelion-precession.test.ts` relaxes the bridge-vs-local
  cross-check from 1e-12 to 1e-4 because the test still uses the
  Schwarzschild fixture's truncated `c = 2.998e8` for GL4 internal
  consistency; Task 4 will canonicalize the fixture and restore 1e-12.
  v0.5.1 Task 2.

### Refactored
- `src/bridges/equations/be-37-shapiro-delay.ts` migrated to canonical
  constants from `src/core/constants.ts`. Replaces two local `c_SI = 299792458`
  literals (lines 305, 485) and two local `G_SI = 6.67430e-11` literals
  (lines 304, 484) with `import { C_SI, G_SI } from '../../core/constants.js'`.
  Migration is **cosmetic only** — values are bit-identical (the file
  already used the exact SI definition and CODATA 2018 value); this
  eliminates the duplication, not a value drift. Helper function
  `buildSchwarzschildEikonalInputs(r, G_SI, c_SI, M_kg)` retains its
  internal parameter names (shadowing is local-scope only). v0.5.1 Task 3.

### Fixed
- BE-37 covariant-eikonal Shapiro residual: `src/numerical/be37-covariant-eikonal.ts`
  migrated from truncated `c_SI = 2.998e8` / `G = 6.6743e-11` to canonical
  `C_SI = 299792458` (exact SI) / `G_SI = 6.67430e-11` (CODATA 2018) imports
  from `src/core/constants.ts`. Dropped the now-obsolete LC-5 "matches
  tests/fixtures/schwarzschild.ts" comment at the old line 38 (Task 5 folded
  in — both consumers now read from `src/core/constants.ts`). **PC-1 verdict
  — REFUTED, not confirmed.** Pre-migration empirical Shapiro relErr was
  `1.76×10⁻⁴` (v0.5.0 Task 11); post-migration relErr is `2.51×10⁻⁴` —
  essentially unchanged-or-worse. The PC-1 audit hypothesis that the
  truncated `c_SI` in this file dominated the residual is therefore wrong:
  canonicalizing the constant did NOT collapse the residual to <1e-5 as
  predicted. The dominant residual contributor lies elsewhere (most likely
  `tests/fixtures/schwarzschild.ts` still on `c_SI = 2.998e8` — addressed
  by Task 4; or a genuine GL4-step / null-IC reconstruction floor). The
  test still clears the ±2×10⁻³ gate. v0.5.1 Task 1.

### Added
- `src/core/constants.ts` flat CODATA 2018 + SI-defined physical-constants
  module. Exports `C_SI`, `G_SI`, `H_SI`, `HBAR_SI`, `K_B_SI`, `E_SI`,
  `ALPHA`, `M_P_SI`, `L_P_SI`, `T_P_SI`, `H0_SI` — single source of truth
  for the constants previously duplicated across `src/numerical/`,
  `src/bridges/`, and `tests/fixtures/`. Re-exported from `src/index.ts`.
  Addresses audit `PC-1` (constant drift between `2.998e8` truncated and
  `299792458` exact `c_SI` across 8 files). `PhysicalConstants` namespace
  in `src/core/types.ts` retained for backwards-compat. v0.5.1 Task 0.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-18

> GR foundations: GL4 symplectic integrator on canonical (x, p) state (Picard inner solver); bisection perihelion finder; curvature layer (RiemannTensorNode AST + ricci/einstein/bianchiResidual helpers); two v0.4.0 `it.skip` debts cleared (BE-52 Mercury Δφ to ±2×10⁻³ relative, BE-37 full Shapiro to ±2×10⁻³ relative); bridge validation sweep (BE-51/52 structural siblings; BE-17/20/45/46/50 physics anchors; catalog-integrity invariant). Adam+Eve adversarial review: 25 findings reconciled.

### Changed
- BE-20 ρ_Λ tolerance tightened from 2× wide to ±5% around Planck 2018 anchor (5.96e-27 kg/m³). v0.5.0 Task 16 (Phase 3d). Replaces the v0.4.x bracket assertion `5e-27 < ρ < 7e-27` (2× wide) with `|ρ − 5.96e-27| / 5.96e-27 < 0.05` against the Planck 2018 anchor (Aghanim et al. 2020 *A&A* 641:A6). Empirical ρ at default Λ=1.1e-52 m⁻² is ≈5.89e-27 kg/m³, within ~1.2% of the anchor — well within the ±5% gate. Audit recommendation #3. Honest framing: if a future refactor drifts outside ±5%, that is a new physics finding to escalate, NOT a threshold-softening target.

### Added
- Catalog-level integrity test (`tests/bridges/catalog-integrity.test.ts`). v0.5.0 Task 20 (Phase 3h, audit recommendation #5). Codifies three suite-level invariants in M1-quantitative form (no `expect(true).toBe(true)`): (1) `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS.length === 42` via the authoritative registry (not a filesystem scan — spec/index drift is separately pinned by `tests/bridges/spec-vs-index.test.ts`); (2) for each entry in `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS`, at least one `tests/bridges/be-NN-*.test.ts` exists (filename pattern, case-insensitive; all 42 bridges currently pass); (3) for each Schwarzschild-spacetime bridge in `[BE-37, BE-51, BE-52]`, at least one `tests/bridges/*.test.ts` both imports the evaluator and contains a literal `integrateGeodesic` or `integrateGeodesicGL4` call — locating Task 10's `tests/bridges/perihelion-precession.test.ts` (BE-52 GL4), Task 11/12's `tests/bridges/gravitational-lensing.test.ts` (BE-51 RK4), and `tests/bridges/be-37-numerical-eikonal.test.ts` (BE-37 indirectly via `evaluateBE37CovariantEikonalNumerical`, whose body invokes `integrateGeodesicGL4`). **Honest plan-deviation on BE-42**: the v0.5.0 Task 20 spec lists BE-42 as a fourth Schwarzschild-spacetime bridge, but the Wave Y 2026-05-07 reformulation replaced the original firewall-complement Hilbert-space ansatz with the canonical Hawking temperature scalar `T_H = ℏc³/(8πGMk_B)` — a closed-form thermodynamic scalar with no geodesic-integration content. The test records BE-42 as an `it.todo` with an inline comment block explaining the gap; promoting it to a real assertion would require either (a) restoring explicit horizon/affine-parameter dynamics to BE-42 or (b) a separate Hawking-radiation-spectrum cross-validation distinct from the geodesic-integrator path. 3 passing + 1 todo.
- BE-50 Cramer 1986 retrocausality anchor test (`tests/bridges/be-50-encoding.test.ts`). v0.5.0 Task 19 (Phase 3g). Validates the time-symmetric residual r_TS = (A_ret − A_adv)/(A_ret + A_adv) against (1) the canonical Wheeler-Feynman absorber-boundary identity r_TS ≡ 0 under A_ret = A_adv and (2) the linear-response Cramer 1986 *Rev. Mod. Phys.* 58:647 §VII experimental bound `|r_TS| < 10⁻²` on physical electromagnetic transactions. Linear-response identity (1 + δ, 1 − δ) → r_TS = δ verified to machine precision. Status 'highly-speculative' preserved (absorber boundary condition empirically untested in QFT). Audit recommendation #4.
- BE-46 Weinberg 1987 Λ_obs window probability anchor test (`tests/bridges/be-46-encoding.test.ts`). v0.5.0 Task 18 (Phase 3f). Validates the Weinberg-Vilenkin parameterization `P(Λ) = A · exp(−α/Λ)` at the canonical Weinberg 1987 prediction Λ_obs ~ α (observed cosmological constant within an order of magnitude of the anthropic upper bound set by galaxy formation, Weinberg 1987 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 59:2607). Recovers P(α) = A · exp(−1) ≈ 0.368 — the order-of-1, non-exponentially-suppressed central success of the anthropic prediction. Tolerance ±10% around exp(−1); status 'highly-speculative' preserved (measure problem unsolved). Audit recommendation #4.
- BE-45 Bedroya-Vafa N_e < 137 Solar-System anchor test (`tests/bridges/be-45-encoding.test.ts`). v0.5.0 Task 17 (Phase 3e). Validates the canonical TCC bound `N_e_max = ln(M_P/H_inf)` evaluated at the present-epoch Hubble scale (H_0 ≈ 1.4e-42 GeV in natural units — the dynamical scale of Solar-System and larger structure today). Achieves N_e ≈ 140 (literature cites 137-140 depending on the low-energy cutoff convention; Bedroya & Vafa 2019 arXiv:1909.11063; Bedroya-Brandenberger-Loverde-Vafa 2020 *Phys. Rev. D* 101:103502). Tolerance: window [60, 145] for the full published range, plus tighter ±5 e-folds around 140 for the canonical anchor. Audit recommendation #4.
- BE-17 neutron-star torsion-density anchor test (`tests/bridges/be-17-encoding.test.ts`). v0.5.0 Task 15 (Phase 3c). Adds an `it('neutron-star spin-polarized torsion density anchor (Hehl 1976 framework)', ...)` that validates the SI-units path of `evaluateBE17SpinDensitySquared` against the textbook spin-polarized NS spin-density-squared scalar `|S|² ≈ 2.78e21 (kg/(m·s))²` (from `|S| = n · (ℏ/2) · f` with n ≈ 1e45 /m³ NS-interior neutron density, ℏ/2 = 5.27e-35 J·s, f = 1 fully polarized worst-case). Order-of-magnitude band ±2 OOM (factor 100) accounts for ~1 OOM EoS uncertainty in n and the upper-bound polarization assumption per Hehl-vonderHeyde-Kerlick-Nester 1976 §V. Round-trip is exact to 10 decimals since the evaluator is pure multiplication of two SI-dimensioned inputs. Closes audit recommendation #2.
- BE-52 structural sibling test (`tests/bridges/be-52-perihelion-precession-structural.test.ts`). v0.5.0 Task 14 (Phase 3b). Closes the audit gap (`docs/architecture/bridge-coverage-audit.md` line 69: BE-52 had NUMERICAL-only coverage). Mirrors Task 13's BE-51 structural-sibling discipline (registry-side `formula_latex` regex against the canonical 6πGM/(a(1−e²)c²) form, `dimensional_signature === '[1]'`, `status === 'established'`, category/bridges/tractability_class/references/notes invariants). **Same plan-deviation as Task 13**: BE-52 has no AST encoding (it lives in `src/bridges/perihelion-precession.ts`, not `src/bridges/equations/`), so the AST-kinds assertion is dropped and replaced with an algebraic-skeleton regex (6π·G·M numerator, a·(1−e²)·c² denominator). 10 tests, all green.
- BE-51 structural sibling test (`tests/bridges/be-51-gravitational-lensing-structural.test.ts`). v0.5.0 Task 13 (Phase 3a). Closes the audit gap (`docs/architecture/bridge-coverage-audit.md` line 68: BE-51 had NUMERICAL-only coverage). Mirrors the BE-37 structural-test discipline adapted for closed-form bridges without an AST encoding: pins `formula_latex` regex against the canonical 4GM/(bc²) form, `dimensional_signature === '[1]'`, `status === 'established'`, category/bridges/tractability_class/references/notes invariants. **Honest plan-deviation**: the plan template (line 1816) listed "tensor-product / metric-layer AST kinds present in the encoded form" as one of four assertions; BE-51 has no AST encoding (it lives in `src/bridges/gravitational-lensing.ts`, not `src/bridges/equations/`), so that assertion is dropped and replaced with a `formula_latex` algebraic-skeleton regex (4·G·M numerator, b·c² denominator). The other three assertions (regex, dim, status) apply directly. 10 tests, all green.

### Changed
- `evaluateBE37CovariantEikonalNumerical` now returns a real `shapiroDelaySec` via GL4 null-geodesic integration (was a documented stub returning 0 in v0.4.0). v0.5.0 Task 12 (Phase 2c). Sets up the null IC on the canonical (x, p) state at `(t=0, r=R_far, θ=π/2, φ=0)` with affine-parameter normalization `p_t = −c²` (so `dt/dτ ≈ 1` far from horizon, τ ≈ coord time), `p_φ = b_m · c` (Killing-vector conservation), and solves `p_r` from the null condition `g^μν p_μ p_ν = 0` at the initial point (negative root for inward motion). Integrates via `integrateGeodesicGL4` with 2048 default steps and `tauMax = 1.5 × (√(R_far²−b²) − √(R_near²−b²))/c`; walks snapshots and linearly interpolates the coord-time `t = x[0]` at `r = R_near_m`. Subtracts the flat-space straight-line transit `(√(R_far²−b²) − √(R_near²−b²))/c` to recover the Shapiro delay. Default impact parameter `b_m = 0` (radial geometry) — reproduces the closed-form `(2GM/c³) · ln(R_far/R_near)` to ≤2×10⁻⁴ relative on solar-scale Earth/Mars geometries (Task 11 cross-check target ±2×10⁻³, actual ~1.8×10⁻⁴ at default steps). New optional `b_m`, `steps` inputs on `BE37CovariantEikonalInputs`. Schwarzschild g^μν and ∂_λ g^μν closures inlined (mirrors `tests/fixtures/schwarzschild.ts`, kept private to avoid src→tests dependency). **Honest plan-deviation from M8/I5:** the plan template's magnitude bound `2e-11 < ... < 3e-10 s` was inconsistent with any standard Shapiro geometry — the same Earth-Mars inputs give ~4 μs against `evaluateShapiroDelay`. The new test uses the geometrically-consistent bracket `[1e-7, 1e-4] s` around the closed-form 4.15 μs for Mars→Earth radial. **Honest plan-deviation on inputs:** plan template had `R_far_m = 1.496e11` (Earth) and `R_near_m = 2.279e11` (Mars) which violates the `R_near ≤ R_far` domain guard; corrected to Mars (R_far) → Earth (R_near). The closed-form cross-check at ±2×10⁻³ tolerance is Task 11's `it.skip` reactivation.
- BE-37 covariant-eikonal Shapiro cross-validation activated (`tests/dimensional/covariant-derivative-preview.test.ts`). Was `it.skip` in v0.4.0; now passes via GL4 null-geodesic integration to ±2×10⁻³ relative (I5 re-relaxation — original v0.4.0 ±1×10⁻⁴ relative was below the double-precision floor: Earth-Mars Shapiro ≈ 2×10⁻¹⁰ s, 1×10⁻⁴ relative = 2×10⁻¹⁴ s absolute, below the ~3×10⁻¹³ s floor on 1500 s coord-time accumulation). v0.5.0 Task 11 (Phase 2b). Empirical `relErr = 1.76×10⁻⁴` at the default 2048 GL4 steps — ~11× tighter than the ±2×10⁻³ I5 gate (residual relErr above the double-precision floor stems primarily from the `c_SI` constant mismatch between `evaluateBE37CovariantEikonalNumerical` at `c_SI = 2.998e8` and `evaluateShapiroDelay` at `c_SI = 299792458` exact; both bridge equations are individually self-consistent against their respective closed forms). Geometry inputs `R_far_m = 1e11`, `R_near_m = 6.96e8` (solar-radius near point, ~Earth-orbit far point) — radial null geodesic (`b_m = 0` default). Both Task 11 (this `it.skip` reactivation) and Task 12 (the underlying `shapiroDelaySec` implementation) compare against the same closed form `(2GM/c³)·ln(R_far/R_near)`. Closes the second v0.4.0 it.skip debt. Best-effort numeric framing per Design §3 Task 2b F20/M6.
- BE-52 Mercury perihelion geodesic cross-validation activated (`tests/bridges/perihelion-precession.test.ts`). Was `it.skip` in v0.4.0; now passes via GL4 + perihelion-finder to ±2×10⁻³ relative (I6). v0.5.0 Task 10 (Phase 2a). Closes the first v0.4.0 it.skip debt. Achieved `relErr = 1.77×10⁻⁷` at 50k GL4 steps (Picard tol=1e-12 default) — ~10⁴× tighter than the I6 target and ~3×10³× tighter than the historical ±5×10⁻⁴ aspiration; the integrator's symplectic Hamiltonian-drift bound + the perihelion-finder's cubic-Hermite root accuracy together far exceed what the 6πGM/(a(1-e²)c²) leading-order closed form can validate against. Newtonian L = √(GM·a(1−e²)) used as the leading-order angular-momentum estimate (GR-corrected L unnecessary at this tolerance — the closed-form bridge is itself leading-order in r_s/a ~ 5×10⁻⁸). Canonical (x, p) initial state from Legendre transform: p_t = −E, p_r = 0, p_θ = 0, p_φ = L, with E = c√((1−r_s/r_p)(c² + L²/r_p²)) (exact from g^μν p_μ p_ν = −c²). Wall-clock: 82s on Windows. M12 deviation: plan asserts `foundPerihelia.length === 2` but `findPerihelion` returns one result by design; the test instead slices snapshots past τ > 0.5·T_orbit and locates the second perihelion only (equivalent guarantee, simpler control flow — documented in the test header).

### Added
- `bianchiResidual(R)` helper in `src/dimensional/curvature.ts` (returns `{residual, evaluate, evaluateMax}`). v0.5.0 Task 9 (Phase 1f). Closes Phase 1 — Foundations. Builds the second-Bianchi-identity cyclic-derivative residual `B_{λμνρσ} = ∇_λ R_{μνρσ} + ∇_μ R_{νλρσ} + ∇_ν R_{λμρσ}` (Carroll Eq. 3.95, ∇_{[λ} R_{μν]ρσ} = 0). **Implementation (Approach 1, full ∇).** Lowering walks the node directly: (1) lowers upper-ρ of R^ρ_{σμν} on the JS side via g_{aρ} (no v0.3.0 `lower()` AST round-trip per FD sample); (2) computes ∂_λ R_{αβγδ} via 4th-order centered FD on the lowered Riemann (h_outer = 1e-4·max(|x|,1) — same step as Task 6's dGamma); (3) builds ∇_λ R_{μνρσ} with four Christoffel-correction terms (one per lower index of R); (4) cyclic-sums over (λ, μ, ν). New `bianchi-residual` ExprNode AST kind (own validator + lowering arms — no AST rewrite into cyclic-op('+') of pderiv products; matches Task 6/7/8 walk-directly philosophy). Validator: 5 free lower indices (synthesised `lambda` + `alpha_lower` + 3 from `R.lowerIndices`); dim L⁻³ (one ∇ added to R's L⁻²). Helper module: new exports in `src/numerical/curvature-lowering-helpers.ts` — `riemannUpperAt`, `lowerFirstIndex`, `riemannLowerAt`, `dRiemannLowerAt`, `covariantDerivRiemannLowerAt`, `bianchiResidualAt`. Quantitative test assertions (M1, no `expect(true).toBe(true)` placeholders): (1) Schwarzschild vacuum — normalized `max|B|/scale` < 1e-5 (scale = max|R|/Lchar), empirical ~1.5e-6 — relaxed from plan's 1e-9 absolute target as the prompt explicitly permits, with the noise-floor compounding documented in the test header (Task-6 Riemann ~8e-10 floor × extra FD layer × 4 Christoffel-correction terms per ∇R); (2) de Sitter — normalized < 1e-5, empirical ~5.7e-6; (3) synthetic JS-side perturbation of clean ∇R at one entry by 10% of scale — confirms cyclic sum jumps to normalized > 0.05, ~4 OOM above vacuum floor (anti-vacuousness, M1 — proves the identity check is NOT trivially passing). **Unitless metric rescaling for vacuum tests.** SI Schwarzschild + de Sitter fixtures carry c² on g_tt; in the Bianchi context, intermediate Γ·R products carry c² and cancellation residuals at IEEE 754 precision swamp the geometric floor by ~10 orders. The Bianchi identity is metric-rescaling-invariant (rescaling g → c²·g rescales R → c²·R and ∇R → c²·∇R; 0=0 survives both sides). Vacuum tests use a unitless (c=1) rescaling of de-Sitter and Schwarzschild — a Bianchi-test-only fixture; SI fixtures remain authoritative for Ricci/Einstein. **evaluateMax convenience + full 5-index evaluate() per F18/M4.** `residual` returns the raw ExprNode for symbolic consumers (validator, equation-homogeneity checks); `evaluate(engine, inputs)` returns the 5-deep nested array; `evaluateMax(engine, inputs)` returns the max-absolute scalar for the common self-consistency check. Public API additions: `bianchiResidual` function-export, `BianchiResidualNode` type-export (both re-exported from `src/index.ts`).
- `einstein(R, g, gInverse)` helper in `src/dimensional/curvature.ts`. Vacuum-Einstein-field-equation scope (Schwarzschild + de Sitter); matter-coupled `G_μν = κ T_μν` deferred to v0.6.0+. Builds an `einstein-tensor` ExprNode wrapping a `RiemannTensorNode` plus the metric pair (g_μν, g^μν). Lowering computes `G_μν = R_μν − ½ R g_μν` by walking the node directly: lowers the inner ricci-tensor (which lowers the inner riemann-tensor → 4×4 R_μν), looks up g_μν and g^μν from `inputs.tensors` (constant raw matrices), computes scalar `R = Σ g^{μν} R_{μν}` on the JS side, then forms G elementwise. No AST rewrite into `op('-', ricci, scale·g)` — the v0.3.5 tensor-product einsum does not natively support a tensor-valued scalar-multiply, and walking the composite node directly mirrors the Task-6/7 philosophy. New `EinsteinTensorNode` AST kind (own validator + lowering arms); validator delegates to `validateRicciTensor` for surviving free-index labels (Einstein and Ricci share `{μ_out, ν_out}` by construction; gLower/gInverse free indices are H1-suppressed, consumed internally). Quantitative test assertions (M1, no `expect(true).toBe(true)` placeholders): (1) Schwarzschild vacuum — max `|G_μν|/scale_local` < 5e-9 (same component-wise normalization as the Task 7 Ricci-vacuum test: `scale_local = |g_μν|` on diagonal, √|g_μμ·g_νν| off-diagonal; empirical floor is ~4.2e-18 — far below the gate); (2) de Sitter — max `|G_μν + Λ g_μν| / |Λ g_μν|` < 5e-10 with Λ=1, r=1 (synthetic values for clean numerics; physical Λ ≈ 1e-52 m⁻² is FD-intractable). Plan target was 1e-10 but the de-Sitter Einstein construction compounds the Task-7 Ricci-floor (1.16e-10) through one extra scalar-trace contraction (`R = g^μν R_μν`, 16 noisy terms) plus the `½ R g_μν` subtraction tensor — total bound ~3·relErr(R) ≈ 3.5e-10. Empirical ~3.13e-10. Relaxed to 5e-10 (same discipline as Task 7's de-Sitter Ricci-scalar relaxation); (3) trace identity `g^μν G_μν = −R` to ≤1e-14 (machine precision — pure algebraic identity since both sides are constructed from the SAME lowered Ricci + metric tensors; empirical 0, exact). Public API additions: `einstein` function-export, `EinsteinTensorNode` type-export (both re-exported from `src/index.ts`). v0.5.0 Task 8 (Phase 1e).
- `ricci(R)` helper in `src/dimensional/curvature.ts` — builds a `ricci-tensor` ExprNode wrapping a `RiemannTensorNode` and contracting it down to R_μν. **Convention:** Carroll Eq. 3.91 — `R_μν = R^λ_{μλν}` contracts upper-ρ against `lowerIndices[1]` (the middle/μ slot). Surviving free indices come from `lowerIndices[0]` (σ slot → Ricci's first free output) and `lowerIndices[2]` (ν slot → Ricci's second free output). **Honest deviation from the Task 7 prompt's stated S1 rule:** the prompt re-introduced "contract upper↔lowerIndices[0] (σ)" as the "fix," but that trace `R^λ_λμν` is identically zero by the lowered Riemann's first-pair antisymmetry — it produces R = 0 for ALL metrics including de Sitter, contradicting the closed-form `R = 4Λ` test target. The de-Sitter Ricci-scalar test is the discriminating fixture (commented inline in `src/dimensional/curvature.ts` and `src/numerical/lowering.ts`). The implementation matches Carroll Eq. 3.91 verbatim, which is the mathematically correct definition. New `RicciTensorNode` AST kind (own validator + lowering arms, no AST-rewrite into `tensor-product` since `RiemannTensorNode` is not contractable in the v0.3.5 einsum sense). New de Sitter fixture (`tests/fixtures/de-sitter.ts`) with full closed-form constant-curvature Riemann `R^ρ_{σμν} = (Λ/3)(δ^ρ_μ g_{σν} − δ^ρ_ν g_{σμ})` populating all 256 entries, mostly-plus −+++ signature, c²-on-g_{tt} SI convention mirroring Schwarzschild. Quantitative test assertions (M1, no `expect(true).toBe(true)` placeholders): (1) tree-structure — `freeIndices.size === 2`, both lower, dim `{L: -2}`; (2) Schwarzschild vacuum — max `|R_μν|/scale_local` < 5e-9 with `scale_local = |g_μν|` for diagonal entries and √|g_μμ·g_νν| for off-diagonals (normalized because Schwarzschild's c²-on-g_tt scales absolute noise on R_tt by c² ≈ 9e16; empirical floor is ~5e-18 normalized — far below the gate); (3) de Sitter — `|R_scalar − 4Λ|/|4Λ|` < 5e-10 with Λ=1, r=1 (synthetic values for clean numerics; the physical Λ ≈ 1e-52 m⁻² is FD-intractable since the curvature signal is many orders of magnitude below the truncation floor); empirical relErr ~1.16e-10 (FD truncation on g→Γ→∂Γ via 4th-order centered stencil, summed through Riemann build, then contracted twice — once for Ricci, once for the scalar trace). Public API additions: `ricci` function-export, `RicciTensorNode` type-export (both re-exported from `src/index.ts`). v0.5.0 Task 7 (Phase 1d).
- Numerical lowering for `RiemannTensorNode` (`src/numerical/lowering.ts` + new `src/numerical/curvature-lowering-helpers.ts`). Direct Γ + ∂Γ via pderiv (M11). `DGammaTensor` type alias pins `dGamma[λ][ρ][σ][ν] = ∂_λ Γ^ρ_{σν}` index order (I3) with a runtime `isFinite(dGamma[1][1][1][1])` assert. Tree size bounded (no AST rewrite into pderiv-of-Γ — walks the node directly per Design §3 Task 1c and §7 R5). Christoffel evaluation reuses the v0.4.0 `computeChristoffelTensor` helper; ∂g (inner FD) and ∂Γ (outer FD) both use **4th-order centered stencils** (truncation O(h⁴)) — the 2nd-order v0.4.0 cov-deriv FD path leaves ~3e-6 relative error on `R^t_{rtr}` because g_{tt} is c²-scaled (~6e16) and cancellation noise propagates through the double FD. 4th-order recovers ≤1e-9. Inner step h_i = 1e-3·max(|x|,1); outer h_o = 1e-4·max(|x|,1). Schwarzschild component match vs the Task 0 analytic fixture: `R^t_{rtr}` relErr ≈ 8.0e-10, `R^θ_{φθφ}` relErr ≈ 8.1e-10 (both clear the ≤1e-9 gate). Lowering surfaces additional non-trivial Schwarzschild Riemann components beyond the Task 0 fixture's two-entry minimum (e.g., `R^r_{trt}` ≈ −2.55e8, `R^r_{θrθ}` ≈ −0.1667, `R^φ_{θφθ}` ≈ 0.333) — all are correct per Carroll Ch. 5; the component-match test's `< 1e-30` zero-skip guard accommodates this scope difference. M1 quantitative antisymmetry on the LOWERED tensor (not the fixture, to avoid vacuity): `R[ρ][σ][μ][ν] + R[ρ][σ][ν][μ]` max-absolute < 1e-14. Inputs contract: `inputs.tensors[xCoord.name]` for the coordinate vector, `inputs.fields[gName]`/`inputs.fields[gInvName]` for coordinate-dependent metric closures (raw constant-tensor metric throws — constant-metric Riemann is identically zero). v0.5.0 Task 6 (Phase 1c-ii).
- `RiemannTensorNode` AST kind in `src/dimensional/connection-validators.ts`; dim = 1/L² (Riemann carries inverse-length-squared units, not dimensionless); Carroll-Ch.3 index convention `R^ρ_{σμν}` with σ in the second lower slot of each Γ (Adam+Eve F4/S3). Validator: dummy/free-index disjointness only on the riemann node's own 4 labels (M9 — legal algebra may reuse labels after explicit raise/lower; we do NOT enforce all-labels-globally-distinct). H1 (v0.4.0 pattern): `gLower` / `gInverse` / `xCoord` sub-nodes are signature-checked but their free indices are NOT propagated (the Riemann formula's contractions consume them internally). Numerical lowering deferred to Task 6 (1c-ii) — the lowering exhaustiveness arm throws `NumericalBackendError` with a Task 6 pointer. v0.5.0 Task 5 (Phase 1c-i). New error path reuses existing `PartialDerivativeIndexVarianceError`, `MetricSignatureError`, `IndexLabelCollisionError`; no new error classes. Public AST + type surface: `RiemannTensorNode`, `UpperIndex`, `validateRiemannTensor`, `RiemannTensorValidationResult` exported from `connection-validators.ts`; `RiemannTensorNode` + `UpperIndex` re-exported from `validator.ts` matching the `CovariantDerivativeNode` precedent. M7 closed-form pin against analytic Schwarzschild was deliberately not duplicated here — the canonical pin lives in `tests/fixtures/schwarzschild.test.ts` (Task 0) using the coordinate-basis Carroll value `R^t_{rtr} = r_s/(r²(r-r_s))`; the plan-template leading-order shorthand `2GM/(6M)³` is off ~33% at finite r and would have been a wrong pin.
- `findPerihelion` bisection finder (`src/numerical/perihelion-finder.ts`) — v0.5.0 Task 4 (Phase 1b). Cubic-Hermite interpolation on cached GL4 snapshots: walks `(τ, x, p)` snapshots, computes `dr/dτ = g^{rν}(x) p_ν` per snapshot, locates the first `− → +` sign-change bracket, fits a cubic Hermite polynomial (4 values: f and f' at both endpoints, endpoint slopes via central differences), then refines the root via bisection **on the polynomial** (not re-integration — Adam+Eve F11/I6: re-integration per bisection step costs a full GL4 sweep and defeats the cached-snapshot approach). Precision floor 1e-9 × T_orbit per Adam+Eve I1 (1e-12 needs ~40 cubic bisections; pointless given the integrator's per-step error). M2 quantitative assertion in test. `PerihelionBracketWidthWarning` emitted via `process.emitWarning` when the bracket width is narrower than the median snapshot Δτ (M3 — documented deviation from the literal `< 2·h_snap` spec: on a uniform-step grid that comparison fires every call since bracket = h_snap exactly; the intent of M3 is to flag *adaptively-compressed* brackets, so we compare against h_snap directly). GL4 + perihelion-finder round-trip integration test (`tests/numerical/perihelion-finder-roundtrip.test.ts`) folded into Task 4 per Adam+Eve M3 (was original Task 5). Round-trip uses Option C1 (flat-space straight-line trajectory with synthetic radial repack) — the physically-faithful Schwarzschild bound-orbit IC are deferred to Task 11 (BE-52 perihelion) where the Legendre transform from orbital E, L lands. Public API surface: `findPerihelion` + types `PerihelionResult`, `FindPerihelionOptions` exported from `src/index.ts` and `src/numerical/index.ts`.
- `integrateGeodesicGL4` symplectic integrator on canonical (x, p) state (`src/numerical/gl4-integrator.ts`). Drives the implicit Picard stage solver per step with **adaptive step-halving on Picard non-convergence** (Adam+Eve I4 — replaces the single-retry R8 design: retry h/2, h/4, … down to `hMin` floor before throwing `GL4ConvergenceError` with a diagnostic message). Cycloid radial-infall match relErr ≈ 8.4e-16 vs the analytic closed form at 5000 steps (`tests/numerical/gl4-integrator.test.ts`, plan target ≤1e-13). Hamiltonian drift ≤ 1e-14 over 1000 steps on a flat-space free particle (symplecticity for non-separable H, demonstrated unambiguously without the curved-spacetime Legendre-transform IC work deferred to Task 11). Domain-violation guard throws `NumericalBackendError` synchronously when `initialState.x[1] < domainMinRadius`. Long-gated `GL4_LONG=1` Mercury 100-orbit Picard-robustness test stubbed per Design §7 R1. Public API surface: `integrateGeodesicGL4` + types `GL4State`, `GL4Snapshot`, `GL4Options` exported from `src/index.ts` and `src/numerical/index.ts`.
- GL4 implicit Picard stage solver in `src/numerical/gl4-integrator.ts` (`solveGL4Stage`, internal). Picard fixed-point iteration (renamed from "simplified Newton" — Adam+Eve S2). Throws `GL4ConvergenceError` (defined in `src/numerical/errors.ts` alongside `EngineCapabilityError`) with specific message `/Picard iteration did not converge/` on non-convergence. Convergence bound ≤40 iterations at tol=1e-12 (flat-space ∂g=0 converges in 2 iterations; Mercury-scale curved spacetime needs 30–40 per Design §3).
- GL4 (Gauss-Legendre 4th-order) integrator scaffold: Butcher tableau constants + canonical (x, p) state types (`src/numerical/gl4-integrator.ts`). Symplectic for the non-separable geodesic Hamiltonian.
- Schwarzschild fixture v0.5.0 API alignment: `gFn`, `gInverseFn`, `dgInverseFn` (TSDoc-pinned index order `dg[λ][μ][ν] = ∂_λ g^{μν}`), `schwarzschildRiemannFn` analytic closed form (scoped to pinning-test components per Task 0 pragmatic-minimum). Index-order guard test added (`tests/fixtures/schwarzschild.test.ts`): asserts `dg[0][1][1] = ∂_t g^{rr} = 0`, `g_μν g^{μν} = 4` round-trip, and M7 Riemann pin `R^t_{rtr}(r=3r_s) = r_s/(r²(r−r_s))` (Adam+Eve M4 + I2 + M7).

### Fixed
- Sign of `dg[1][0][0] = ∂_r g^{tt}` in `tests/fixtures/schwarzschild.ts` (Task 0 regression caught by Task 3 cycloid test). Correct value is `+r_s/(r²(1−r_s/r)²c²)`, not negative — the wrong sign reverses the radial force in the GL4 geodesic flow and causes test particles to drift outward instead of falling inward. Regression-pinned in `tests/fixtures/schwarzschild.test.ts` (`dg[1][0][0]` assertion + `> 0` guard).

## [0.4.6] - 2026-05-17

> Minimize/simplify pass — refactor + dead-code + type-safety + comment-honesty release.
> No new features, no breaking changes, no physics changes (v0.5.0 scope).
> 22 mechanical fixes across 5 tracks (unreachable code, lies in comments, type-safety holes,
> algorithmic simplifications, release). All 32 audit findings addressed (some batched).
> Adam+Eve adversarial reconciliation pass before execution caught 18 plan defects.
> New shared `src/numerical/strides.ts` utility module. No new public API.

### Fixed
- AS-7: einsum `operandFlatIndex` in `float64-engine.ts` now uses precomputed per-operand axis maps (`freeAxesByOp`, `contractAxesByOp`) instead of iterating `spec.free`/`spec.contractions` on every element computation. Reduces inner-loop spec iteration for medium-rank tensor contractions.
- AS-5: tensor.ts Step C Map deletion changed from Array.from(merged.entries()) snapshot to collect-keys-then-delete; allocates only the small contracted-label string[]. Minor allocation reduction per validated tensor product.
- AS-4: `forEachMultiIndex` in `connection-lowering-helpers.ts` no longer spreads `idx` on every `visit` call. Eliminates N^4 array allocations per covariant-derivative lowering (256 per call in N=4 spacetime). Visitor invariant documented.
- AS-8: `computeChristoffelTensor` now precomputes all N metric derivative arrays before the triple loop. For N=4 with 'supplied' strategy: ~96 flattenNA calls reduced to 4 (O(N^4) loop structure unchanged; constant factor reduced).
- AS-2: duplicate `sameShape` function consolidated into `strides.ts` (alongside `rowMajorStrides`/`flatIndex` from AS-3). Both `float64-engine.ts` and `connection-lowering-helpers.ts` now import from the shared module.
- AS-3: `rowMajorStrides` and `flatIndex` (4 duplicated functions total) extracted from `float64-engine.ts` and `connection-lowering-helpers.ts` into new shared module `src/numerical/strides.ts`; both consumer modules now import from there. Regression tests added in `tests/numerical/strides.test.ts`.
- TS-7, TS-8: `isEinsumSpec` and three metric-validator result interfaces annotated to clarify intentional public export vs internal use. Comment-only.
- TS-6: `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` in `bridge-check.ts` marked `@internal`. Not a breaking change — export preserved, stability guarantee clarified. Comment-only.
- TS-5: `validator.ts` `probeCtx.violations.length === 0` in the `^` exponent inference probe replaced with `okFromViolations(probeCtx.violations)` — warning-severity violations from the probe no longer cause `actualDim` to fall back to `DIMENSIONLESS`. Fix confirmed after precondition audit: `Violation.severity` field and `okFromViolations` helper both exist in the file.
- TS-4: ofIndices structural cast in lowering.ts narrowed from `variance: string` to `variance: 'upper' | 'lower'`; downstream redundant cast removed.
- TS-2: runtime guards added in lowering.ts for CovariantDerivativeNode.of (unknown→ExprNode) and gLower (cast to MetricTensorNode) — throws NumericalBackendError with a clear message for malformed ASTs bypassing validate().
- TS-3: Float64ReferenceEngine AD dispatch (add/sub/mul/scale) replaced duck-typed 'tangent'/'tape' property checks with instanceof EngineDualTensor / EngineTapedTensor — safer and type-discriminated within the module.
- TS-1: mathts-engine.ts autograd typed with a local MathTSAutograd interface instead of 'any'. 4 'as any' casts at call sites eliminated. Single 'as unknown as MathTSAutograd' cast at import site.
- AS-1: pderiv.ts `flattenToNumbers` (identical to `flattenNA` in `connection-lowering-helpers.ts`) removed; three call sites now import `flattenNA`. Reduces flatten implementations from 3 to 2 (`flattenNA` + `flattenNestedArray` wrapper). Regression tests added.
- UC-1: strategy cast in `lowering.ts` narrowed from `'zero' | 'supplied'` to literal `'supplied'` at the `getMetricDerivFlat` call (the `'zero'` arm was unreachable after the line-457 early return).
- UC-2: dead `else` branch (lines 482-486) in `lowering.ts` covariant-derivative partial computation removed; replaced with an explicit `NumericalBackendError` throw documenting the upstream invariant (`of` is always `tensor-symbol` or `metric-tensor` for a validated node).
- LC-2: mathts-engine.ts module-level and class-level JSDoc tense corrected ('becomes' → 'became') — MathTSEngine is already the default since v0.4.0. engine-registry.ts already used past tense; no change needed there. Comment-only.
- LC-1: evaluateBE37CovariantEikonalNumerical function JSDoc rewritten to be honest about its stub nature — it returns {eikonalResidual:0, shapiroDelaySec:0} and does not use the covariant-derivative or lowering infrastructure. Comment-only.
- LC-5: stale 'CRITICAL (finding #1 of v0.3.5 adversarial review)' prefix removed from lowering.ts buildEinsumSpec JSDoc. Also removed 'finding #1' back-reference at line ~249. Comment-only.
- LC-6: Float64ReferenceEngine class JSDoc updated to say 'fallback engine in v0.4.0+' rather than 'v0.3.5's default engine'. Comment-only.
- UC-6/comment: connection-validators.ts comment about gLower/gInverse validation corrected — they are NOT validated via validateChild; signature checks at lines 71-88 are sufficient. Comment-only.
- LC-3, LC-7, LC-8, LC-9: four comment fixes — flattenNA 'canonical' claim updated (duplicate consolidated); connection-validators stale Task-18 ref removed; src/index.ts version comment updated; getMetricDerivFlat key format example corrected. All comment-only.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-05-17

> Pure refactor + benchmark scaffold release. No new features, no bridge work (v0.5.0 scope), no breaking changes. LOC delta: +84 net across 39 bridge test files (helper file +81 LOC; migration net +3 LOC). Benchmarks are correctness-first baselines for v0.5.0+ comparison, not optimization wins.

### Added
- `bench/geodesic.bench.ts`: Schwarzschild radial infall at 1k/5k/10k RK4 steps (Task 9, v0.4.5). Benches `integrateGeodesic` with canonical cycloid-infall inputs (M=M_sun, r₀=100·r_s, η=0.5). Baseline for v0.5.0 symplectic-integrator comparison. `benchmarkTimeout` raised to 30 000 ms (F11). `bench/fixtures/schwarzschild.ts`: bench-local Christoffel closure (isolated from `tests/` for build and publish safety). Raw results in `docs/architecture/benchmarks.md`.
- `bench/be37-eikonal.bench.ts`: BE-37 Shapiro RK4 eikonal end-to-end baseline (Task 8, v0.4.5). Benches `evaluateBE37EikonalNumerical` (4096-step RK4, solar grazing scenario, ~813 hz / 1.2 ms/call) and `evaluateBE37CovariantEikonalNumerical` (v0.4.0 structural preview stub, ~762k hz). `benchmarkTimeout` raised to 30 000 ms (F11). Establishes AST→lowering→RK4 roundtrip baseline for v0.5.0 symplectic integrator comparison. Raw results in `docs/architecture/benchmarks.md`.
- `bench/ad.bench.ts`: forward + reverse AD baseline for `fn(x)=x*x` across 4 tensor shapes (`[10]`, `[100]`, `[10,10]`, `[100,100]`) and both engines (`Float64ReferenceEngine` always; `MathTSEngine` skipped gracefully if optional dep absent). Tensors pre-built outside bench callback (F4 discipline). Establishes v0.4.5 AD performance baseline; no threshold gates. Raw results documented in `docs/architecture/benchmarks.md`.
- `bench/` directory with Vitest bench infrastructure (Task 6, v0.4.5). `npm run bench` runs benchmarks via `vitest bench` (tinybench, already bundled — no new devDependency). `npm run bench:ci` runs benchmarks with verbose reporter for CI log capture (vitest 4.1.4 has no built-in JSON benchmark reporter; `--reporter=json` targets the test reporter, not bench). `bench/sanity.bench.ts` validates the toolchain with `Math.sqrt` (no UPT imports). Honest framing: this establishes baselines, not optimization — no threshold gates in v0.4.5 (gated regression deferred to v0.5.0). `bench/` excluded from npm tarball (verified with `npm pack --dry-run`; implicit via `files` whitelist). Node ≥ 18 required (already enforced by `engines` field).
- `docs/architecture/benchmarks.md`: v0.4.5 baseline results table (hz, median, p99) for all bench suites: sanity, AD [10]/[100]/[10,10]/[100,100], BE-37 Shapiro eikonal, Schwarzschild geodesic 1k/5k/10k.

### Refactored
- Bridge test helpers final migration Parts V-VI + v0.4.0 additions (Task 5c, v0.4.5): migrated 34 bridge test files (`be-28` through `be-50`, including reformulation variants `be-37-r3-disposition`, `be-43-reformulation`, `be-50-reformulation`). All module-scope and describe-scope `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS.find(...)` lookups replaced with `expectBridgeInIndex(id)` calls inside `it()` blocks (F5 constraint). Inline `validate + format` round-trip patterns replaced with `expectDimRoundTrip(rhs, sig)`. Four-line known_issues blocks in reformulation files replaced with `expectHasReformulationIssue(entry)`. Fix-test files (`be-11-fix`, `be-29-fix`, `be-47-fix`, `be-48-fix`) intentionally skipped (non-standard structure). Net LOC delta for Task 5c: 303 insertions / 398 deletions (−95 net) across 34 files. Test count preserved per file; 1061 passing + 1 skipped. Also fixed two partial-migration residuals in `be-25-iit-encoding.test.ts` and `be-28-onsager-encoding.test.ts` where `format` import had been stripped but `format()` calls remained inline — replaced with `expectDimRoundTrip`.
- Bridge test helpers bulk migration Parts II-IV (Task 5b, v0.4.5): expanded `tests/bridges/_helpers.ts` with `expectHasReformulationIssue(entry)` (asserts known_issues non-empty + has severity='phenomenological-ansatz'/fixable='reformulation' entry). Migrated 15 files: 12 reformulation tests (`be-12` through `be-38`) + 3 encoding tests (`be-13`, `be-18`, `be-20`). Module-scope `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS.find(...)` lookups moved inside `it()` blocks per F5 constraint; 4-line known_issues blocks replaced by `expectHasReformulationIssue` in 11 of 12 reformulation files (be-33 uses fixable-only check, kept inline). Test count preserved per file.
- Bridge test helpers pilot (Task 5a, v0.4.5): added `tests/bridges/_helpers.ts` with two helpers — `expectBridgeInIndex(id, status?)` (catalog lookup + optional status pin, returns entry) and `expectDimRoundTrip(rhs, sig)` (validate + format round-trip). Both called INSIDE `it()` blocks only (F5 constraint). Migrated 5 pilot encoding files: `be-19`, `be-22`, `be-26`, `be-27`, `be-35`. All 89 tests pass. Helper API frozen for Tasks 5b/5c bulk migration.

### Fixed
- Misleading JSDoc comment on `flattenNA` in `src/numerical/connection-lowering-helpers.ts`. The comment incorrectly claimed `flattenNestedArray` in `lowering.ts` was removed; the accurate description now explains the size-assertion distinction between the two functions.

### Changed
- `Float64Tensor` class in `float64-engine.ts` is now non-exported (was already `@internal`). Not a breaking change — was never in `src/index.ts` public surface. Use the `EngineTensor` interface and `TensorEngine` contract for all engine-adapter work.

### Removed
- Deprecated `RepeatedDummyLabelError` alias from `src/dimensional/errors.ts` (scheduled since v0.2.0; use `DuplicateIndexLabelError`). Not a breaking change — was never in the `src/index.ts` public surface. Note for sub-path consumers: if you reached into `src/dimensional/errors` directly, migrate to `DuplicateIndexLabelError`.
- Unused dimensional-signature constants from `src/dimensional/constants.ts`: `epsilon_0`, `t_P`, `m_P`, `E_P` (added speculatively in v0.1.0; zero downstream imports verified). Not a breaking change — none were in `src/index.ts` public surface. Note for sub-path consumers: if you reached into `src/dimensional/constants` directly for these symbols, construct the equivalent `Dimension` literal inline (e.g., for ε_0: `{ L: -3, M: -1, T: 4, I: 2, Theta: 0, N: 0, J: 0 }`).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- Default `getActiveEngine()` is now `async` and returns `Promise<TensorEngine>`. When both `@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor` AND `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd` are installed, it resolves to `MathTSEngine`; otherwise falls back to `Float64ReferenceEngine` with a one-time `console.warn` (suppressible via `UPT_QUIET_FALLBACK=1`). **Honest framing: both engines run the same naive O(n) algorithms in v0.4.0; this default flip is a dep-shape + code-path-signal change, NOT a performance win.** MathTSEngine becomes default because that is where the autograd (AD) capability lives. `setActiveEngine` now wraps its argument in `Promise.resolve` to match the async contract. Concurrent first-time `getActiveEngine()` calls share a single in-flight Promise (I4 race-fix). `process.env` access guarded by `typeof process !== 'undefined'` for browser-bundler compatibility (I5 fix).

### Added
- v0.4.0 public-surface snapshot test (`tests/api/public-surface.test.ts`): runtime + type-only two-pronged guard covering 10 new `@public` entries (`christoffel`, `CovariantDerivativeNode`, `integrateGeodesic`, `evaluateGravitationalLensing`, `evaluatePerihelionPrecession`, `evaluateBE37CovariantEikonalNumerical`, `hasAutogradSupport`, `EngineCapabilityError`, `DuplicateCoordinateWarning`, `ForwardGradResult`, `ReverseGradResult`). Each entry documented with one-line `@public` rationale in `docs/planning/v0.4.0-api-surface.md`. `isChristoffelSymmetric` NOT present — removed per E9 review.
- `evaluateBE37CovariantEikonalNumerical` structural preview (residual=0 by null-wave-covector construction). First v0.3.5 `it.todo` in `covariant-derivative-preview.test.ts` activated and passing; second `it.todo` changed to `it.skip` pending v0.5.0 geodesic-integrated Shapiro cross-check. [v0.4.0 structural-preview only; Shapiro deferred to v0.5.0]
- `evaluatePerihelionPrecession` (BE-52 Einstein 1915). Closed-form Δφ = 6πGM/(a(1−e²)c²) per orbit; reproduces Mercury's ~43 arcsec/century anomalous precession to <0.5". Domain: bound orbits only (0 ≤ e < 1, a > 0, T > 0). Bridge catalog 41 → 42 (IDs 11-52). Geodesic cross-validation (Task 16b [U]): deferred to v0.5.0 — requires symplectic integrator + bisection perihelion finder (see `it.skip` block in `tests/bridges/perihelion-precession.test.ts` for full diagnosis). Root cause: the GR perihelion advance for Mercury (Δφ ≈ 5.02e-7 rad/orbit) is below the perihelion timing resolution achievable with `integrateGeodesic`'s sparse 100-snapshot trajectory; the snapshot-based r-minimum detection introduces ±0.052 rad φ error (∼1e5 × Δφ_GR), making the RK4 cross-validation unmeasurable at the required ±1e-4 relative precision without a bisection finder and a symplectic integrator.
- `evaluateGravitationalLensing` (BE-51 Eddington 1919). Closed-form α = 4GM/(bc²); validated against the canonical grazing-solar-ray result of ~1.75 arcsec. Domain check: b > 0. Geodesic cross-validation (null RK4, 200k steps) confirms to ±1e-4 relative error. Bridge catalog now 40+ entries (41 total, IDs 11-51).
- `integrateGeodesic` RK4 Schwarzschild geodesic integrator (validated vs. cycloid form to ±1e-6). `GeodesicIntegratorInputs.domainMinRadius` explicit option enforces r ≥ 3·r_Schwarz domain restriction (Task 14 [U]).
- HYBRID covariant-derivative coordinate-shadow handling (Task 13 [U]): default throws `MetricSignatureError`; `UPT_ALLOW_COORD_SHADOW=1` downgrades to `DuplicateCoordinateWarning` via `process.emitWarning`. `DuplicateCoordinateWarning` is the canonical class (lives in `src/dimensional/errors.ts`, re-exported from `src/numerical/index.ts`; uses `Object.setPrototypeOf` for correct `instanceof`).
- covariant-derivative lowering path (3 derivativeStrategy modes) in `src/numerical/lowering.ts`; helpers extracted to `src/numerical/connection-lowering-helpers.ts`.
- `tensor-partial-derivative` lowering extended to handle `of.kind === 'metric-tensor'` for 'zero'/'supplied'/'computed' strategies.
- optional `MetricTensorNode.derivativeStrategy` ('computed' | 'zero' | 'supplied', defaults 'computed').
- `covariant-derivative` AST node (`src/dimensional/connection-validators.ts`); dedicated validator case with internally-consumed metric indices.
- `christoffel()` helper in `src/dimensional/connection.ts` — composite builder for Γ^λ_μν as a tree of v0.3.0 AST nodes.
- `NumericalInputs.metricDerivatives` field + `metricDerivSupplied()` helper.
- optional `forwardGrad`/`reverseGrad` methods on `TensorEngine` (always `Promise`-returning per S6 uniform-async reconciliation). `ForwardGradResult` / `ReverseGradResult` result types.
- `EngineCapabilityError` (extends `NumericalBackendError`, `Object.setPrototypeOf` pattern for correct `instanceof`).
- `hasAutogradSupport(engine)` — returns `true` iff engine implements both AD methods.
- `Float64ReferenceEngine.forwardGrad`/`.reverseGrad` (pure-TS dual-number + tape AD).
- `MathTSEngine.forwardGrad`/`.reverseGrad` (adapter over `@danielsimonjr/mathts-autograd`).
- `tests/numerical/ad-conformance.ts` parameterized AD conformance suite (6 cases: capability detect, forward fn=x·x, reverse fn=x·x, default cotangent, rank-2 Jacobian shape, shape-mismatch error) — cross-repo AD contract run against both engines.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-05-14

> Numerical-contraction backend. UPT ASTs now evaluate to concrete numbers:
> a `TensorEngine` interface with a pure-TypeScript, zero-dependency
> `Float64ReferenceEngine` (the default) plus a second `MathTSEngine` backed
> by `@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor`, both passing an identical parameterized
> conformance suite. Adds AST→engine lowering, two-way numerical partial
> derivatives, `InverseMetricInconsistencyWarning`, and the BE-37
> Shapiro-delay eikonal evaluated end-to-end and cross-checked against the
> closed form to ±1e-9 relative error. Designed via a full brainstorm +
> two-pass Adam/Eve adversarial review; the TensorEngine pivot (away from
> the original TF.js/mathjs hybrid) and every task were adversarially
> reviewed. SemVer MINOR — additive `numericalForm` + `Violation.severity`
> fields, new `src/numerical/` module, no breaking changes.

### Added
- `evaluateBE37EikonalNumerical()`: end-to-end numerical evaluation of the BE-37 Shapiro-delay eikonal, cross-checked against the closed form to ±1e-9.
- `src/numerical/null-ray-integrator.ts`: fixed-step RK4 integrator for affine-parameterized null geodesics.
- `evaluateNumerical` / `evaluateNumericalRaw` public surface +
  `engine-registry.ts`.
- `TensorEngine` interface (`src/numerical/tensor-engine.ts`) and
  parameterized engine-conformance suite.
- `Float64ReferenceEngine` (`src/numerical/float64-engine.ts`), the
  pure-TypeScript zero-dependency `TensorEngine` implementation.
- `Float64ReferenceEngine` einsum / matMul / transpose / reshape; passes the
  full engine-conformance suite.
- optional `Violation.severity` ('error' | 'warning', defaults 'error');
  warnings no longer fail `ValidationResult.ok`.
- optional `TensorSymbolNode.numericalForm` ('symbolic' | 'numerical-fn' |
  'grid', defaults 'symbolic').
- `src/numerical/pderiv.ts` + `GridField`: 'grid' / 'numerical-fn' /
  'symbolic' numerical partial derivative.
- `src/numerical/lowering.ts`: AST → `EngineTensor` lowering with `buildEinsumSpec`.
- `MathTSEngine` (`src/numerical/mathts-engine.ts`): second `TensorEngine`, backed by `@danielsimonjr/mathts-tensor` (optionalDependency).
- `InverseMetricInconsistencyWarning`: `evaluateMetricInverse` (numerical, auto-fires in `evaluateNumerical`) + `validateInverseMetricPair` (opt-in symbolic). Resolves the v0.3.0 deferral.
- numerical-correctness + einsum-property test layers; `numericalForm`-preservation regression test.
- `src/numerical/` re-exported from the root barrel; `public-api-stability.test.ts` extended; `@public`/`@internal` tags across the numerical module.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-13

Patch release: 3 verified-real fixes from the v0.3.0 RLM audit (Sonnet
code review + Adam (Gemini 2.5 Pro) / Eve (OpenAI o3-mini) adversarial
cross-check). All changes are additive bug fixes — no API changes, no
spec changes; v0.3.0 callers stay compatible.

### Fixed
- `validateKroneckerDelta` (Part-VIII §VIII.3) now rejects same-label
  indices like `δ^μ_μ` with `IndexLabelCollisionError`. Before this
  fix, the trace form silently collapsed to a single-entry freeIndices
  Map (the second `Map.set` overwrote the first), producing a malformed
  result instead of surfacing the trace-vs-free-index ambiguity.
  `validateMetricTensor` already had the analogous duplicate-label
  check; parity restored.
- `integral` and `derivative` AST cases in `src/dimensional/validator.ts`
  no longer use shallow `{ ...ctx, path }` spreads when recursing into
  child operands. The spread copied top-level fields but
  `ctx.freeIndices` is a `Map` (shared by reference), so a tensor-valued
  integrand or derivand silently leaked its free indices into the
  parent accumulator. Both cases now use the existing `inferArgLocal()`
  helper, which gives each child a fresh local Map. v0.3.0 has no
  tensor-integral / tensor-derivative semantics (those would require
  Part-IX); these operators stay dimensional scalar and child
  free-indices stay local.
- `v030-additive-semver-minor-bump` (Part-VIII §VIII.11) TENSOR-RULE
  now has a real backing test in
  `tests/dimensional/part-viii-spec-vs-impl.test.ts`: asserts
  `package.json` version is in the 0.3.x line and that the Part-VIII
  marker exists in the spec. Previously the rule was satisfied only by
  an orphan-anchor JSDoc comment, so the drift guard was vacuously
  green for this rule. The orphan-anchor reference has been removed
  from the JSDoc block (the `pderiv-of-metric-composes` anchor stays —
  it's still covered by a Task-12-forward `it.todo`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-13

Metric-layer release. UPT now structurally encodes the Lorentzian /
Euclidean metric tensor, the Kronecker delta identity, and the
covariant partial-derivative operator. The first GR-flavored bridge
(BE-37 Shapiro time-delay) is structurally encoded using these
primitives. Load-bearing prerequisite for v0.4.0 (Christoffel symbols,
covariant derivative) and the v0.3.5 mathjs numerical backend.

Two-pass adversarial design review by Adam (Gemini 2.5 Pro) + Eve
(OpenAI o3-mini); execution via subagent-driven 16-task pipeline.

### Added
- AST node type `metric-tensor` with rank-2 same-variance indices, a
  signature string (`'+,-,-,-'` Lorentzian, `'+,+,+'` Euclidean, etc.),
  and per-encoding `dim` field. Validated by `validateMetricTensor` in
  the new `src/dimensional/metric-validators.ts` module.
- AST node type `kronecker-delta` (canonical `δ^μ_ν` identity tensor) —
  rank-2 mixed-variance, dim defaults to `DIMENSIONLESS`. Required for
  v0.4.0 covariant-derivative identities and the deferred
  `InverseMetricInconsistencyWarning`.
- AST node type `tensor-partial-derivative` with always-covariant
  `wrtIndex` (TypeScript-enforced via `CovariantIndex` type). Rank
  increases by 1; `dim = divide(of.dim, wrt.dim)`; `wrt`'s own free
  indices are deliberately discarded (the operator's index is
  supplied separately). Role inherits from `of` when `of` is a
  `tensor-symbol`; defaults to `'field'` otherwise (Design §13 Q1
  locked decision).
- User-facing helpers in new `src/dimensional/metric.ts` module:
  `metric(name, indices, dim, signature)`,
  `kronecker(upperLabel, lowerLabel, dim?)`,
  `pderiv(of, wrt, wrtIndex)`,
  `raise(operand, gInverse, label)`,
  `lower(operand, g, label)`. The raise/lower helpers perform
  **internal alpha-conversion** (Decision 8a): one of the metric's
  labels is renamed to match the operand's contraction label; the
  other is renamed to a deterministic fresh label avoiding all
  collisions with the operand's free indices. Output is a vanilla
  `tensor-product` that flows through the existing `computeContraction`
  algebra unchanged.
- 5 new error subclasses, all subclassing `UPTError`:
  `InvalidMetricRankError`, `MetricSignatureError`,
  `InvalidKroneckerRankError`, `KroneckerVarianceError`,
  `PartialDerivativeIndexVarianceError`. Local-only
  `RaiseLowerInvalidLabelError` for raise/lower validation (private to
  `metric.ts`).
- Spec module `docs/specification/Part-VIII-Metric-Layer.md` with 25
  `<!-- TENSOR-RULE: <id> -->` markers covering metric / Kronecker /
  pderiv invariants, the raise/lower contract, the v0.5.0+
  Faraday-cascade BREAKING-scope flag, and the SemVer posture.
- Drift guard `tests/dimensional/part-viii-spec-vs-impl.test.ts` —
  bidirectional spec↔impl enforcement (every marker referenced; every
  reference points at a real marker). Part-VII guard extended to
  union markers from both spec files (its phantom-marker check now
  accepts Part-VII OR Part-VIII references).
- v0.4.0 covariant-derivative preview test
  `tests/dimensional/covariant-derivative-preview.test.ts`: one
  passing test locking the `∂_μ g_νλ` rank-3 all-covariant
  composition shape (the building block for v0.4.0 Christoffel work)
  plus 2 `it.todo` entries for the Christoffel symbol and covariant
  derivative themselves.
- AST → JSON round-trip serialization test for all three new node
  kinds (including the nested `wrtIndex` object on pderiv).
- **BE-37 Shapiro time-delay** structurally encoded using the
  null-geodesic eikonal form `g^μν (∂_μ S)(∂_ν S) = 0`. New exports
  `BE37_EIKONAL_LHS`, `BE37_EIKONAL_RHS_ZERO`,
  `validateBE37EikonalDimensions` live alongside the preserved v0.2.1
  scalar form. The structural form exposes the tensor-structural
  origin of the Shapiro scalar `Δt = (2GM/c³)·ln(R_far/R_near)`.
  Bridge selection rationale in
  `docs/planning/v0.3.0-Bridge-Selection.md`.

### Changed
- `VarianceMismatchError` message refreshed to suggest
  `raise(operand, gInverse, '<label>')` and `lower(operand, g, '<label>')`
  with the concrete label inlined. The v0.2.0 message ended with
  "v0.2.0 has no metric to raise/lower indices, so this contraction
  is rejected" — historically inaccurate in v0.3.0. Message text is
  not part of the SemVer contract (Part-VIII §VIII.11).
- `validator.ts` `ExprNode` discriminated union extended with three
  new arms (`MetricTensorNode`, `KroneckerDeltaNode`,
  `TensorPartialDerivativeNode`). Total arms: 9.
- `resolveChildForContraction` extended with branches for
  `metric-tensor` and `kronecker-delta` so they can appear directly
  as tensor-product args (lowers to `math.Matrix` in v0.3.5).
- New `resolveChildForPartialDerivative` helper in validator.ts —
  separate from `resolveChildForContraction` because pderiv children
  carry the optional `role` field through the recursion.
- Part-VII §VII.7 (partial-derivative preview) updated to point at
  Part-VIII §VIII.4 for the canonical specification. The 2-field
  shape lock from v0.2.0 remains accurate; v0.3.0 extends it
  additively with the `wrt: ExprNode` field per the preview's own
  authorization.

### Deferred
- `InverseMetricInconsistencyWarning` machinery deferred to v0.3.5.
  Requires a `Violation.severity: 'error' | 'warning'` field on
  `ValidationResult.violations` — a substantive enrichment cleaner
  to bundle with the mathjs numerical-backend introduction. TODO
  marker in `src/dimensional/metric-validators.ts`; two `it.todo`
  entries in new `tests/dimensional/inverse-metric-consistency.test.ts`.
  Per Design §13 Q2 locked decision.

### Forward-compat
- All three new node kinds JSON-round-trip losslessly (v0.3.5 mathjs
  RPC contract per Design §14.1-§14.2).
- `metric-tensor.dim`, `tensor-symbol.dim`, and `kronecker-delta.dim`
  are single-`Dimension` fields — uniform-component-dim assumption
  baked in. Part-VIII §VIII.10 commits future-self to the v0.5.0+
  refactor (Faraday-tensor mixed-component-dim support) with eyes
  open. Three nodes participate in this BREAKING refactor.
- `∂_μ g_νλ` composes cleanly (covariant-derivative-preview.test.ts);
  v0.4.0 Christoffel work activates the two `it.todo` entries
  without retrofitting v0.3.0 ASTs.
- All 5 new error subclasses inherit `UPTError` (per v0.2.0-Design.md
  §14.7 contract); downstream mathjs/threejs consumers can
  discriminate UPT-source errors uniformly via `instanceof UPTError`.

### Documentation
- v0.3.0-Design.md: 16-section design doc with two-pass adversarial
  cross-validation record. Commit `4d7d2d3`.
- v0.3.0-Implementation-Plan.md: 16-task plan with bite-sized TDD
  steps, Bridge / Forward-compat anchors per task. Commit `213c667`.
- v0.3.0-Bridge-Selection.md: BE-37 selection decision record with
  candidate survey, sketch, and "what the sketch tells us" insights.
  Commit `eeb0829`.
- v0.2.0-Design.md §12 roadmap: v0.3.0 row marked shipped 2026-05-13.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-13

Patch release: one correctness fix + naming cleanup + documentation
improvements identified by post-v0.2.0 adversarial review (OpenAI
o3-mini + Gemini 2.5 Pro comprehensive pass).

The correctness fix is the load-bearing change: `contract(tsum(A, B), C)`-
style expressions (a tensor-product containing a tensor-aware op '+'
sub-expression) now contract correctly. v0.2.0 silently dropped the
sub-expression's free indices, leaving them un-contracted. Affects any
bridge encoding that combines tensor sums with tensor products.

### Fixed
- `validator.ts` `resolveChildForContraction`: tensor-aware non-tensor-symbol
  / non-tensor-product children (e.g., `op '+'` tensor sums) no longer have
  their `freeIndices` silently discarded when serving as args of a
  `tensor-product`. `contract(tsum(A^μ, B^μ), C_μ)` now correctly contracts
  μ to scalar. Regression test added to `tensor-product.test.ts`. Commit
  `568ade3`. Discovered by post-release OpenAI o3-mini + Gemini 2.5 Pro
  adversarial review.

### Changed
- **BREAKING (deprecation alias retained):** Renamed `RepeatedDummyLabelError`
  → `DuplicateIndexLabelError`. The original name was a misnomer: in
  tensor-calculus convention, a "dummy index" is summed-over (contracted),
  whereas this error fires on declaration-time duplicates of FREE indices
  within a single `tensor-symbol`'s indices list. Backward-compat alias
  `export const RepeatedDummyLabelError = DuplicateIndexLabelError` is
  retained with `@deprecated` and will be removed in v0.3.0. Commit
  `0493cf0`.
- `IndexLabelCollisionError`: optional `sources?: ReadonlyArray<string>`
  constructor parameter for richer error messages when the caller has
  per-operand provenance. Backward-compatible (optional; existing 2-arg
  callers unchanged). Commit `0493cf0`.

### Documentation
- `computeContraction` JSDoc: explicit paragraph on the v0.2.0 implicit-
  identity-metric assumption, flagging that v0.3.0's metric layer will
  generalize the pairing rule. Commit `0493cf0`.
- `TensorSymbolNode.role` field: inline JSDoc per Part-VII §VII.8.
  Commit `0493cf0`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-12

Tensor-algebra layer added. UPT now structurally encodes tensors with
variance-typed index labels and the Einstein summation contraction
rule. Bridges with tensor structure no longer rely on typed-stubs.

### Added
- AST node type `tensor-symbol` with variance-typed indices and an
  optional `role: 'coordinate' | 'field' | 'constant'` field.
- AST node type `tensor-product` with automatic Einstein contraction
  of matched upper/lower index pairs.
- `ValidationResult.freeIndices: Map<string, {upper, lower}>` tracks
  uncontracted indices per subtree.
- `UPTError` base class; all UPT error types now subclass it for
  downstream `instanceof` discrimination.
- New error types: `RepeatedDummyLabelError`, `IndexLabelCollisionError`,
  `VarianceMismatchError`, `TensorInScalarOpError`,
  `FreeIndexMismatchError`.
- User-facing helpers: `tsym(name, indices, dim, role?)`, `scale(s, t)`,
  `contract(...args)`, `tsum(...args)`.
- Pure function `computeContraction(args)` exported for the future
  mathjs numerical backend.
- Spec module `docs/specification/Part-VII-Tensor-Algebra.md` with
  `<!-- TENSOR-RULE: <id> -->` markers and a partial-derivative
  preview section (v0.3.0 implementation pre-locked).
- Drift guard `tests/dimensional/tensor-spec-vs-impl.test.ts`.
- AST → JSON round-trip serialization test.
- Public-API stability snapshot test for TensorJS forward-compat.
- Structured `known_issues[]` arrays for the 16 R4-tier bridges that
  previously had prose-only concerns.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** removed `T_torsion_squared` typed-stub from BE-17.
  Migration: use `tsym` + `contract` to express the structural form.
  BE-17 is the sole structurally-encoded tensor bridge in v0.2.0;
  Task 12 found that BE-33 / BE-36 / BE-43 reformulated to scalar
  canonical forms during Wave-P and have no tensor structure to
  encode (see v0.2.0-Design.md §13.8).
- `DimensionMismatchError` moved from `algebra.ts` to `errors.ts` (re-
  exported from `algebra.ts` for backward compatibility).
- `op '+' / '-'` now require matching `freeIndices` across all args
  (in addition to matching dimensions). Scalar + scalar behavior
  unchanged.
- `op '*' / '/' / '^'` now reject tensor operands. Use `tensor-product`
  for tensor multiplication.

### Documentation
- v0.2.0-Design.md: design doc with §14 forward-compat checks for
  TensorJS readiness. Cross-validated by OpenAI o3-mini and Gemini 2.5
  Pro.
- v0.2.0-Implementation-Plan.md: this plan.
- Bridge-Remediation-Plan.md: refreshed to post-Wave-Z state.

### TensorJS forward-compat
- AST → JSON round-trip is lossless (sanity check for mathjs RPC).
- `computeContraction` exported for mathjs numerical-backend reuse.
- `BridgeEquation` interface snapshot-tested for stability.
- All UPT errors subclass `UPTError` for cross-layer interop.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-12

First tagged release. Marks the transition out of pre-formalization to a
stable scaffold:

- **Dimensional analyzer is sound** — 240+ tests covering arity, switch-
  exhaustiveness, integral/derivative shape guards, with 22 named SI
  dimensions and round-trip `format()`.
- **Bridge index is correct and self-consistent** — 40 entries with
  dispositioned status, cross-field invariants enforced; spec markdown
  and TypeScript index do not drift (`tests/bridges/spec-vs-index.test.ts`).
- **Encoded subset round-trips** — every entry whose RHS lives in
  `src/bridges/equations/` validates back to its registered
  `dimensional_signature` via the catalog test.
- **Tier-5 AST encoding coverage: 40 / 40** — every BE-N (N ∈ 11..50) has
  an AST module, numerical evaluator with input validation, and
  per-bridge tests. Status distribution: 6 established · 31 speculative
  · 3 highly-speculative · 0 invalid.
- **Test suite: 1161 / 1161** across 68 files.

The catalog is closed in the rank-6 / scalar-AST scope at this point.
Further encoding would require AST primitive extensions (deferred per
Wave 2 leverage analysis) or domain-judgment reformulations on bridges
currently dispositioned `speculative`.

Sections below this header document the Wave A → Wave Z arc that
produced this release. Wave-narrative headings (`### Wave X — topic`)
record the chronological work; classical Keep-a-Changelog buckets
(`### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, etc.) appear from the older
sections downward.

### Wave Z Gemini cross-validation — three docstring scope-note enhancements (2026-05-11)

After the Wave Z final-review sweep, the `llm-gemini` MCP transport
reconnected (post-`/reload-plugins`) but the Gemini reasoning tool did
not re-register in ToolSearch. Direct-Python invocation of
`google-genai` via the project's `client.generate()` succeeded, giving
us the long-deferred **Gemini Pro independent verdict** on the three
Wave-Z reformulations from `status='invalid'` or contested status.

**Gemini Pro verdicts** (model `gemini-2.5-pro`, thinking_budget 8192,
max_output_tokens 32768):

| Bridge | Reformulation | Verdict | Agreement with OpenAI o3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| BE-16 | Landauer's principle | **STRONGLY-DEFENSIBLE** | Agree |
| BE-37 | Shapiro delay | **STRONGLY-DEFENSIBLE** | Agree |
| BE-28 | Onsager σ | **DEFENSIBLE-WITH-CAVEATS** | Agree with the nuanced later o3 verdict (pragmatism wins between imperfect options) |

**Both reasoners — OpenAI o3 and Gemini Pro — independently confirmed
all three reformulations as defensible.** No reversal, no fundamental
disagreement. The cross-validation closes the asymmetric-LLM-coverage
gap noted at the close of Wave Z-G.

Gemini Pro recommended three specific scope-note enhancements,
applied verbatim to the corresponding module docstrings:

- **BE-16 (`be-16-landauer.ts`):** added clarifying note that
  `E_min = k_B T ln(2)` is a fundamental *lower bound* on the energy
  dissipated — equivalently, on the entropy generated in the
  environment via `ΔS_env = E_min/T = k_B·ln(2)` — during the
  irreversible act of **erasing one bit**. NOT a general
  proportionality for arbitrary information change. NOT an equality
  for non-erasure operations (computation, copying,
  measurement-without-reset). Both reasoners verdicted STRONGLY-
  DEFENSIBLE.

- **BE-37 (`be-37-shapiro-delay.ts`):** added clarifying note that
  the Shapiro delay manifests as an **apparent** coordinate-time
  slowdown of light traversing curved spacetime, NOT a variation in
  the fundamental constant `c` as measured by any local inertial
  observer. By Einstein's equivalence principle, every local
  observer measures the speed of light to be exactly `c` in their
  own inertial frame. The "effective c < c" interpretation is a
  coordinate-system artifact in the global Schwarzschild frame, not
  a physical local effect. This distinction is precisely what makes
  Shapiro survive the Ellis-Uzan critique — vacuum c(t,x)-variation
  is operationally meaningless precisely because it conflates the
  local-measurement and coordinate-system pictures. Both reasoners
  verdicted STRONGLY-DEFENSIBLE.

- **BE-28 (`be-28-onsager-entropy-production.ts`):** upgraded the
  honest-claude warning prefix from "IMPORTANT" to "**⚠ CRITICAL
  WARNING — Definiendum vs. principle**" with the Gemini-Pro-recommended
  wording: "This bridge is retained under the BE-28 label for
  historical continuity, but it represents the **definiendum** of
  MEPP (the quantity MEPP makes a claim about), NOT the maximization
  conjecture itself." The warning makes the relabeling distinction
  unambiguous for any future reader, addressing the Wave-Z-D
  consultation's original concern that "Onsager mislabels MEPP" while
  honoring the user's explicit choice to accept the trade-off.

**MCP transport investigation findings (corrected 2026-05-11 after process-inspection):**

- The `llm-gemini` MCP stdio process disconnected mid-session during
  Wave-Z work. `/reload-plugins` reported "12 plugin MCP servers"
  reloaded, but the `gemini_*` tools did not re-register in
  ToolSearch. The OpenAI MCP tools re-registered cleanly in the same
  reload, ruling out plugin-wide failure.
- **Initial (wrong) diagnosis**: I first wrote that the server
  process existed but its `@mcp.tool()` handlers hadn't propagated.
  That was a guess and it was wrong.
- **Actual diagnosis** (from `wmic process where "name='python.exe'"`
  inspection): **the Gemini MCP server process is not running at all**.
  Two `servers.openai_mcp.server` processes (PIDs 17272, 18836 —
  likely one orphan + one live) exist for the sibling OpenAI server,
  but **zero `servers.gemini_mcp.server` processes**. The reload's
  "12 plugin MCP servers" count tallies config entries reloaded, not
  spawned PIDs. So this is a spawn failure / silent skip, not a
  tool-registration race.
- **What's healthy** (verified):
  - `python -m servers.gemini_mcp.server` starts cleanly when run
    manually (waits on stdin as expected).
  - The `client.generate()` function works first-try when called
    directly — we got a 2028-output-token cross-validation response
    from gemini-2.5-pro in one shot (input 830, thinking 2981,
    output 2028, finish_reason=STOP).
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY` env var is set (39 chars).
- **Likely cause** (lower confidence): a stale-PID-tracking issue in
  the mcp-host plugin's reload path. Hypothesis: when the original
  Gemini server crashed silently mid-session, its PID was orphaned
  from the host's tracking. `/kill-plugins` then killed processes
  the host *knew about* (no longer including the dead Gemini PID),
  and `/reload-plugins` saw "Gemini server: not in active set"
  without distinguishing "needs spawn" from "already running."
  Evidence: 2 OpenAI processes (orphan + live) suggests the host
  is spawn-without-clean-killing in at least some paths.
- **Workaround used this session**: direct-Python `client.generate()`
  invocation, bypassing the MCP transport entirely. This is a
  reliable escape hatch for any future MCP-transport failure where
  the underlying SDK + credentials are healthy.
- **Next-session diagnostics**:
  1. Check process creation timestamps: `wmic process where
     "name='python.exe'" get processid,commandline,creationdate
     /format:list` — if the older OpenAI process predates this
     session's `/reload-plugins`, the host is spawn-without-clean-
     killing; that confirms the stale-tracking hypothesis.
  2. Capture the Gemini server's stderr by wrapping the .mcp.json
     command in a small launcher that redirects `sys.stderr` to a
     log file before importing `servers.gemini_mcp.server`. The
     stdio MCP transport eats stderr by default, hiding crash
     traces.
  3. Full Claude Code restart (end SSH/tmux, reconnect, `claude
     --continue`) to force a clean spawn of all servers. If Gemini
     comes up under a fresh session but fails again after
     `/kill-plugins` + `/reload-plugins`, the issue is specifically
     in the reload path, not the cold-start path.

**Final state (unchanged from Wave Z-G):** 40/40 AST coverage,
0 status='invalid', 0 null dimensional_signature,
0 tractability_class='undefined', 1161/1161 tests passing.
This cross-validation pass adds **three scope-note enhancements** to
the three reformulated bridges' docstrings; no code, test, or index
changes.

### Wave Z final-review sweep — docstring corrections (2026-05-11)

After completing Wave Z-A through Z-G (40/40 catalog coverage), a final
paper-reviewer sweep on all 11 new/reformulated modules surfaced three
high-confidence findings. The sweep also re-verified each module's
physics correctness, dimensional analysis, citation completeness, and
honest-claude scope discipline. Eleven modules reviewed; **all eleven
pass the closure gate** with the three minor corrections below.

**High-confidence corrections applied:**

- **BE-15 (`be-15-emergence.ts`)** — date typo in inline reference:
  `"Kawasaki-Gunton (1978) derived this scaling"` → `(1976)`. The
  references list already cited the correct 1976 *Phys. Rev. A* 13:2294
  paper; the inline date was mistyped.

- **BE-37 (`be-37-shapiro-delay.ts`)** — numerical bracket
  clarification: the docstring previously claimed the Sun-grazing
  one-way delay was `Δt ≈ 0.246 ms`, but that figure is the
  **round-trip** Shapiro 1964 radar-bounce experiment (4GM/c³ form);
  the encoded **one-way** form `2GM/c³·ln(R_far/R_near)` actually
  gives ~53 μs for the same geometry. The docstring bracket-check
  and the evaluator's `@returns` doc are now both corrected, with an
  explicit note that the one-way encoded form is NOT directly
  comparable to the historical round-trip Shapiro result. The
  evaluator implementation and test ranges were already correct (the
  test bracket spans 1e-5 to 5e-4 s, comfortably including 53 μs);
  only the docstring numerical narrative was wrong.

- **BE-25 (`be-25-iit-phi.ts`)** — added IIT 4.0 caveat to
  honest-claude scope notes: the encoded
  `ii(s,s̃) = p(s̃|s)·log₂[p(s̃|s)/p(s̃)]` is the *pointwise-KL* /
  Wikipedia simplified form. IIT 3.0 (Oizumi-Albantakis-Tononi 2014)
  and IIT 4.0 (Albantakis et al. 2023) use the **earth-mover's
  distance** (Wasserstein metric) as the canonical irreducibility
  measure on the cause-effect repertoire. The log-ratio is preferred
  because it has an AST-encodable closed form; Wasserstein would
  require a transport-plan primitive not in the grammar. The two
  metrics agree qualitatively for small systems.

**Minor improvements applied:**

- **BE-16 (`be-16-landauer.ts`)** — precision claim refined: the
  docstring previously cited Bérut 2012 and Jun 2014 jointly as
  "to within ~10%"; updated to specify that Bérut 2012 confirmed
  the relation consistent with the bound (without quoting a specific
  precision figure), and Jun-Gavrilov-Bechhoefer 2014 achieved ~3%
  precision in their follow-up single-electron experiment. Matches
  the literature more accurately.

**Cross-cutting observations (no action required):**

- All 11 modules consistently use the typed-stub idiom across BE-17
  (tensor contraction), BE-25 / BE-37 / BE-45 / BE-46 (log/exp
  stubs), BE-28 (index-collapsed force-flux sum), and BE-15 (kinetic
  coefficient).
- Honest-claude discipline is strong across the board. BE-28 carries
  the most prominent relabeling warning (as required, since it is
  the most aggressive reformulation — the only one that does NOT
  preserve its bridge label).
- All three Wave Z-E/F/G reformulations from `status='invalid'`
  follow the Wave-P-D BE-25 precedent (drop the broken form, replace
  with a canonical literature form). The reformulations are
  internally consistent and dimensionally correct.
- BE-35 is the only Wave-Z module with `status='established'`
  (verified consistent between docstring and index entry); the
  justification is that the crossing-symmetry identity is canonical
  CFT bootstrap content with decades of literature support — the
  *symmetry identity* is established, while the bridge framing
  remains the speculative element absorbed into the catalog label.

**No physics errors detected.** All dimensional arithmetic in the
11 modules was verified by hand against the encoded `dim` literals
and the validator's inference. All citations match canonical
references in the published literature.

**Final closure verdict: Wave Z arc is ready to ship as a clean
milestone.** The catalog is at 40/40 AST coverage with no
status='invalid', no null dimensional_signature, no
tractability_class='undefined', and 1161/1161 tests passing.

### Wave Z-G — Reformulation + AST encoding for BE-28 (Onsager entropy production) — **40/40 FULL COVERAGE** (2026-05-11)

Reformulates BE-28 from MEPP's variational formulation (which requires
variational-δ + Lagrange-multiplier + discrete-sum grammar primitives
the UPT AST does not have) to the **Onsager linear-response
entropy-production scalar** σ = Σᵢ Jᵢ Xᵢ. **User-confirmed design
choice** after the relabeling concern was surfaced via AskUserQuestion;
see Wave Z-G honest-claude scope notes for the full trade-off.

This brings the framework to **40/40 active AST modules — full
catalog coverage**.

- **BE-28 Onsager entropy production** (`be-28-onsager-entropy-production.ts`):
  encodes

      σ = Σᵢ Jᵢ Xᵢ

  as a single typed-stub `force_flux_product` with dim
  `[entropy/time]` = `[L² M T⁻³ Θ⁻¹]` = `[W/K]`. The discrete index
  sum over species (heat-flux/∇T, particle-flux/∇μ, charge-current/
  electric-field, etc.) is collapsed into the typed-stub — the AST
  has no discrete-index sum primitive, so the multi-species content
  is absorbed. Same idiom as BE-17 `T_torsion_squared` (typed-stub
  for tensor contraction) and BE-46 `exp_factor` (typed-stub for
  transcendental). Inferred RHS dim ✓.

  `dimensional_signature` null → `'[L^2 M T^-3 Theta^-1]'`. Status
  `'speculative'` retained. `tractability_class` `'formally-divergent'`
  → `'closed-form'`. Numerical evaluator enforces Second-Law σ ≥ 0
  with RangeError on negative input (with error message guiding
  toward sign-convention check).

  Refs: Onsager 1931 *Phys. Rev.* 37:405 / 38:2265 (foundational
  reciprocal-relations papers); de Groot-Mazur 1962 textbook
  (canonical); Dewar 2003 / 2005 (MEPP, now dropped); Grinstein-
  Linsker 2007 (MEPP rebuttal); Prigogine 1947 (minimum-EP, the
  contrasting principle).

  **⚠ IMPORTANT honest-claude scope (REQUIRED reading):**
  - This reformulation **does NOT capture MEPP's variational
    maximization claim**. Onsager linear-response is canonical,
    uncontested physics that defines the entropy production rate
    but says nothing about NESS selection. MEPP claims that "of all
    admissible NESS, nature selects the one maximizing σ subject
    to constraints" — that claim is the actual MEPP content and is
    NOT preserved by the encoded form.
  - The reformulation is closer to a **renaming** of BE-28 (MEPP →
    Onsager entropy production) than to the BE-25 / BE-16 / BE-37
    reformulations, which preserved their bridge labels
    (consciousness ↔ information; information ↔ thermodynamics;
    modified light propagation). MEPP's bridge label "Why nature
    chooses specific NESS" is NOT preserved by Onsager.
  - The user explicitly chose this reformulation in Wave Z-G after
    the relabeling concern was surfaced via AskUserQuestion,
    accepting the trade-off: **40/40 active bridge encodings at the
    cost of MEPP's variational semantic content**. Future readers
    should understand the encoding answers "what is the entropy
    production rate?" but NOT "why does nature select this rate?"
  - The OpenAI o3 Wave-Z-D consultation cautioned against this
    move ("Onsager mislabels MEPP"); the Wave-Z deferred-bridges
    revisit (Wave-Z-E/F/G consultation) reaffirmed the same caution
    but also offered Onsager as the most-canonical relabeling
    available. Both consultations are cited in the module docstring.
  - Onsager linear-response is **already implicitly used** by BE-21
    (KSS η/s bound), BE-23 (SYK Planckian resistivity), and BE-29
    (Jarzynski). BE-28's distinguishing role is to encode the σ
    scalar itself, not a derived transport coefficient or
    fluctuation theorem.

**Catalog coordination:**

- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` (`src/dimensional/bridge-check.ts`):
  added `[28, {L:2, M:1, T:-3, Theta:-1}]` with extensive Wave-Z-G
  honest-claude comment.
- `ENCODED_RHS` (`tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`):
  added BE28_ENTROPY_PRODUCTION_RHS entry.
- Cross-check map size pin (`tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts`):
  bumped 39 → **40 (FULL COVERAGE)**; id allowlist updated.
- Orphan allowlist (`tests/bridges/orphan-dimensional-signature.test.ts`):
  added 28 to `ENCODED_RHS_IDS`.

**Counts (FINAL STATE):**

- AST encodings: 39/40 → **40/40 active modules — FULL COVERAGE**.
- Test suite: 1143/1143 → **1161/1161 passing**.
- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`: 39 → 40 entries.
- `status='invalid'` count: **0** (no invalid bridges).
- `tractability_class === 'undefined'` count: **0** (all populated).
- `dimensional_signature === null` count: **0** (all populated).

**Catalog status: 100% coverage.** Every BE-N (N ∈ {11..50}) has:
- a populated `dimensional_signature` matching its AST encoding;
- an AST module in `src/bridges/equations/be-N-*.ts`;
- a numerical evaluator with Second-Law / dimensional / range guards;
- per-bridge encoding test plus participation in the cross-cutting
  catalog round-trip, orphan-invariant, and dimension-map size tests.

**Wave-Z arc summary** (the 8 commits that closed the catalog):
1. Wave Z-A (9cb299f): 4 dimensionless reductions (BE-32, 35, 46, 50).
2. Wave Z-B (8e1a38c): BE-25 IIT inner ii(s,s̃) via log₂-stub.
3. Wave Z-C (1581733): BE-17 Einstein-Cartan + BE-44 soft hair.
4. Wave Z-D (00f4379): BE-15 Kawasaki-Gunton coarsening.
5. Wave Z-E (29932bf): BE-16 reformulated → Landauer.
6. Wave Z-F (05900f3): BE-37 reformulated → Shapiro delay.
7. Wave Z-G (this commit): BE-28 reformulated → Onsager σ.

Reaching 40/40 required **three reformulations from `status='invalid'`
or contested-principle** (BE-16, BE-37, BE-28), each documented with
honest-claude scope notes describing what the reformulation drops
relative to the original framing. BE-28 specifically carries the
strongest honest-claude warning: the encoding does not capture MEPP's
variational maximization claim, only the Onsager linear-response
scalar that NESS theory operates on.

### Wave Z-F — Reformulation + AST encoding for BE-37 (Shapiro gravitational time delay) (2026-05-11)

Reformulates BE-37 from `status='invalid'` (vacuum c(t,x)≠const ansatz
operationally meaningless per Ellis-Uzan 2005 *Am. J. Phys.* 73:240
arXiv:gr-qc/0305099 "c is the speed of light, isn't it?") to
`status='speculative'` via the **Shapiro gravitational time delay** —
the canonical operationally-meaningful "effective-c" effect that
survives the Ellis-Uzan critique. Identified by OpenAI o3 in the
Wave-Z reopened deferred-bridges consultation. Same precedent as
Wave P-D R-D2 BE-25 (Penrose-Hameroff → IIT) and Wave Z-E BE-16
(Complexity-Entropy → Landauer).

- **BE-37 Shapiro delay** (`be-37-shapiro-delay.ts`): encodes

      Δt = (2 G M / c³) · ln(R_far / R_near)

  via the **typed-prefactor + log-stub** idiom. The prefactor 2GM/c³
  is encoded explicitly with G (`[L³M⁻¹T⁻²]`), M (`[mass]`), and c
  via the `^` operator for c³; the validator infers
  `[T³/T²] = [T]` ✓. The log argument `R_far/R_near` is a
  dimensionless ratio of two lengths — exposed as `BE37_LOG_RATIO_ARG`
  for the lemma test (same convention as BE-45 `BE45_LOG_RATIO_ARG_MP_HINF`).
  The ln itself is replaced by a fresh DIMENSIONLESS symbol stub
  `ln_R_ratio`. Inferred RHS dim: `[T] · [1] = [time]` ✓.

  `dimensional_signature` null → `'[time]'`. `status` `'invalid'`
  → `'speculative'`. `tractability_class` `'undefined'` → `'closed-form'`.
  Name updated: "Variable Speed of Light Cosmology" → "Modified
  light-propagation: Shapiro gravitational time delay".

  Refs: Shapiro 1964 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 13:789 (original prediction);
  Will 1981/2014 textbook (PPN framework); Bertotti-Iess-Tortora
  2003 *Nature* 425:374 (Cassini solar-conjunction measurement of γ
  to ~10⁻⁵); Ellis-Uzan 2005 (the critique that motivated
  reformulation). Albrecht-Magueijo 1999, Moffat 1993, Barrow 1999,
  Magueijo 2003 retained as historical VSL context.

  **Honest-claude scope notes:**
  - The reformulation REPLACES the vacuum c(t,x)-variation ansatz with
    Shapiro delay. Shapiro is general-relativistic gravitational
    physics, NOT a "varying c" in any fundamental sense — light always
    travels at c locally; the delay arises from the integrated path
    length / coordinate-time effects in curved spacetime.
  - The Albrecht-Magueijo / Moffat / Barrow vacuum-c-variation
    proposals (three non-equivalent canonical VSL ansätze) are NOT
    recovered. The Wave Z-F move is to drop VSL entirely in favor of
    the operationally-meaningful gravitational time-delay, not to
    pick one of the three (each of which fails Ellis-Uzan
    independently).
  - The encoded form uses the GR-canonical PPN parameter γ=1 (i.e.,
    coefficient 2GM/c³). A more general PPN encoding would use
    (1+γ)GM/c³ with γ as a free parameter (Bertotti-Iess-Tortora
    2003 constrained |γ-1| < 2.3e-5).
  - Status `'speculative'` is for the **bridge framing** (treating
    Shapiro delay as THE UPT "modified-light-propagation" bridge),
    NOT for Shapiro delay itself, which is canonical.
  - The two original known_issues (operationally-undefined,
    phenomenological-ansatz) are retained for historical record but
    `fixable` updated to `'reformulation'` with
    `[RESOLVED Wave Z-F reformulation 2026-05-11]` prefix in the
    descriptions.

**Catalog coordination:**

- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` (`src/dimensional/bridge-check.ts`):
  added `[37, TIME]` with Wave-Z-F comment.
- `ENCODED_RHS` (`tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`):
  added BE37_SHAPIRO_DELAY_RHS entry.
- Cross-check map size pin (`tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts`):
  bumped 38 → 39; id allowlist updated.
- Orphan allowlist (`tests/bridges/orphan-dimensional-signature.test.ts`):
  added 37 to `ENCODED_RHS_IDS`.
- R3-disposition test (`tests/bridges/be-37-r3-disposition.test.ts`):
  rewritten to verify the Wave Z-F reformulation rather than the
  legacy R3 invalid status. Now checks status='speculative',
  formula_latex is the Shapiro form (not the c(t) ansatz), all
  known_issues are `fixable: 'reformulation'`, references cite
  Shapiro 1964 / Bertotti-Iess-Tortora 2003 / Ellis-Uzan, and
  dimensional_signature is `'[time]'`. The historical
  `BE-37-VSL-Disposition-Brief.md` citation is preserved in notes
  for traceability.
- `tractability_class === 'undefined'` invariant test
  (`tests/bridges-index.test.ts`): updated from "at least one
  undefined" to "no undefined" — Wave Z-F was the last bridge with
  `tractability_class === 'undefined'`. All 40 bridges now have an
  explicit `tractability_class`.

**Counts:**

- AST encodings: 38/40 → **39/40 active modules**.
- Test suite: 1114/1114 → **1143/1143 passing**.
- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`: 38 → 39 entries.
- `status='invalid'` count: 1 → **0** (BE-37 was the last; both
  historical 'invalid' bridges are now reformulated to 'speculative').
- `tractability_class === 'undefined'` count: 2 → **0** (all 40
  bridges now have a populated tractability_class).

**Remaining gap:**

- **BE-28 (MEPP)**: the ONLY remaining bridge without an AST
  encoding. OpenAI o3's Wave-Z consultation explicitly cautioned
  against reformulating MEPP to Onsager linear-response — "Onsager
  is uncontested established physics; MEPP's unique content is the
  variational maximization claim, which requires variational-δ +
  Lagrange + discrete-sum grammar primitives." Reformulating MEPP
  to a non-MEPP scalar would be relabeling, not the same precedent
  as the BE-25 / BE-16 / BE-37 moves (where the reformulated form
  addresses the same bridge label). MEPP stays deferred pending
  either a grammar extension or a different canonical scalar that
  preserves MEPP's variational content.

**Final realistic state: 39/40 active AST modules.** Reaching 40/40
requires either (a) a grammar extension (variational-δ + Lagrange-
multiplier + discrete-sum), or (b) finding a canonical scalar
reformulation of MEPP that preserves the variational maximization
content. Neither is straightforward; both are research-scale moves
beyond the Wave Z sweep.

### Wave Z-E — Reformulation + AST encoding for BE-16 (Landauer's principle) (2026-05-11)

Reformulates BE-16 from `status='invalid'` (broken `dS/dt = k_B·C(ρ)·∂I/∂t`
ansatz, algebraically self-refuting, C(ρ) undefined) to `status='speculative'`
via Landauer's principle, identified by OpenAI o3 in the Wave-Z reopened
deferred-bridges consultation. Same precedent as Wave P-D R-D2 BE-25
Penrose-Hameroff → IIT reformulation.

- **BE-16 Landauer's principle** (`be-16-landauer.ts`): encodes

      E_min = k_B · T · ln(2)

  the minimum thermodynamic energy per bit of information erased
  (Landauer 1961). k_B has dim `[energy/temperature]`; T has dim
  `[temperature]`; ln(2) is a concrete dimensionless numerical
  constant `[1]`. Product dim: `[energy]` ✓. The ln(2) is encoded as
  a single DIMENSIONLESS symbol `ln_2_constant` (no inner-argument
  lemma test needed — the argument 2 is a literal number, not a
  dimensionful ratio; differs from BE-25 / BE-45 log-stubs where
  arguments are dimensionful ratios).

  `dimensional_signature` null → `'[energy]'`. `status` `'invalid'`
  → `'speculative'`. `tractability_class` `'undefined'` → `'closed-form'`.
  Name updated from "Complexity-Entropy Production Relation" to
  "Information-Thermodynamics Bridge (Landauer's principle)".

  Refs: Landauer 1961 *IBM J. Res. Dev.* 5:183 (canonical original);
  Bennett 1973/1982 (reversible computation); Bérut et al. 2012
  *Nature* 483:187 (first experimental confirmation); Jun-Gavrilov-
  Bechhoefer 2014 *PRL* 113:190601 (precision test ~3%); Yan et al.
  2018 *PRL* 120:080507 (quantum extension); Reeb-Wolf 2014 *NJP*
  16:103011 (rigorous QIT formulation). Susskind 2014 (arXiv:1402.5674)
  and Brown-Roberts-Susskind 2016 (arXiv:1509.07876) retained as
  historical context — they inspired the original (broken) C(ρ)
  ansatz, now dropped.

  **Honest-claude scope notes:**
  - The reformulation REPLACES the algebraically-self-refuting
    original ansatz with Landauer's principle, dropping `C(ρ)`
    entirely. This is the same move pattern as BE-25 (Penrose-
    Hameroff → IIT). Wave P-D-style reformulation.
  - Landauer is a *lower bound* on the *minimum* energy per bit
    erased — NOT a proportionality between *complexity* and
    *entropy-production rate* as the original ansatz claimed. The
    reformulation captures the spirit of the bridge label
    (`microscale → emergent`, information ↔ thermodynamics) but not
    the original formula's intended structure.
  - The three known_issues entries (undefined-quantity,
    sign-convention, self-refuting) are retained for historical
    record but `fixable` updated from `'unfixable-must-mark-invalid'`
    to `'reformulation'` (matching the cross-field invariant —
    a 'speculative' bridge must not carry unfixable issues; we
    document that they WERE addressed via reformulation).
  - Other canonical bridges exist (Margolus-Levitin τ_min ≥ πℏ/(2E);
    Bremermann's limit; Bennett reversible-computation bound). Future
    BE entries could encode these as separate bridges. Landauer was
    chosen because it is the simplest, most-cited, and most directly
    matches the `microscale → emergent` label.
  - Quantum extensions (Reeb-Wolf 2014; Yan 2018) refine the bound
    for non-Markovian / coherent erasure. The encoded form is the
    **classical Landauer bound**; quantum corrections are not in
    scope.

**Catalog coordination:**

- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` (`src/dimensional/bridge-check.ts`):
  added `[16, ENERGY]` with Wave-Z-E comment.
- `ENCODED_RHS` (`tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`):
  added BE16_LANDAUER_RHS entry.
- Cross-check map size pin (`tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts`):
  bumped 37 → 38; id allowlist updated.
- Orphan allowlist (`tests/bridges/orphan-dimensional-signature.test.ts`):
  added 16 to `ENCODED_RHS_IDS`.
- Index-level disposition pin (`tests/bridges-index.test.ts`): updated
  from `status === 'invalid'` to `status === 'speculative'` with
  `formula_latex === 'E_{\\min} = k_B T \\ln 2'`, documenting the
  Wave-Z-E reformulation.
- isActiveStatus filter test: BE-16 now INCLUDED in the active set.
- All three BE-16 known_issues: `fixable` changed from
  `'unfixable-must-mark-invalid'` to `'reformulation'`, with
  `[RESOLVED Wave Z-E reformulation 2026-05-11]` prefix in
  descriptions.

**Counts:**

- AST encodings: 37/40 → **38/40 active modules**.
- Test suite: 1092/1092 → **1114/1114 passing**.
- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`: 37 → 38 entries.
- `status='invalid'` count: 2 → 1 (BE-16 reformulated; BE-37 next).

### Wave Z-D — AST encoding for BE-15 (Model A Kawasaki-Gunton coarsening) (2026-05-11)

Encodes BE-15 (Universal Emergence Equation — Hohenberg-Halperin
Model A) via the **late-stage coarsening scaling-law reduction**
identified by OpenAI o3 in a dedicated consultation (Wave Z-D, 2026-05-11).
This was previously flagged as "deferred grammar-extension" because the
full Model A Langevin equation requires Dirac-δ correlators, functional
δ-derivatives, and functional integration — none of which are in the
UPT AST grammar.

- **BE-15 Kawasaki-Gunton coarsening** (`be-15-emergence.ts`): encodes
  the squared-form relation

      L(t)² = Γ · t

  as an exact algebraic equality. Γ is the Model A kinetic coefficient
  with dim `[L² T⁻¹]`; t is time `[T]`; the product yields `[area]` =
  `[L²]` = dim(L²). The encoded `L(t)² = Γ·t` is the canonical
  Kawasaki-Gunton (1976) coarsening scaling for non-conserved order
  parameters in the linear (Allen-Cahn 1979) regime and in the scaling
  regime of the nonlinear theory. The z = 2 dynamic critical exponent
  distinguishes Model A from Model B (z ≈ 3, L ~ (Γt)^{1/3}) and Model
  H (fluid corrections).

  `dimensional_signature` null → `'[area]'`. Status `'speculative'`
  not lifted — Model A is canonical condensed-matter physics, but the
  bridge framing (Model A as the UPT microscale-↔-emergent bridge)
  remains the speculative element.

  Refs: Hohenberg-Halperin 1977 *Rev. Mod. Phys.* 49:435 (canonical
  critical-dynamics); Kawasaki-Gunton 1976 *Phys. Rev. A* 13:2294
  (original L ~ √Γt derivation); Allen-Cahn 1979 *Acta Metall.*
  27:1085; Bray 1994 *Adv. Phys.* 43:357 (canonical coarsening review);
  Chaikin-Lubensky 1995 textbook Ch. 8.

  **Why squared-form not root-form.** AST `^` requires dimensionless
  exponents; a non-integer power on a dimensionful base would require
  a `sqrt` primitive the grammar does not provide. The squared form is
  an exact algebraic equality whose dimensions check directly; the
  root `L(t) = √(Γt)` lives in the numerical evaluator
  `evaluateCoarseningLength`. Same precedent: BE-17 squared invariant.

  **Why Kawasaki-Gunton over alternatives** (per OpenAI o3 consultation):
  - **Equipartition `⟨|φ_k|²⟩ = k_BT/(Γω_k)`** is generic statistical
    mechanics (applies to any linearized field theory at equilibrium).
    Encoding it would mislabel BE-15 as generic stat-mech rather than
    Model A dynamics. Rejected.
  - **FDT amplitude `D = 2Γk_BT`** is just the noise-correlator
    coefficient; loses all dynamical content. Rejected.
  - **Equal-time correlation `C(r) ~ exp(-r/ξ)`** requires an exp-stub
    and a typed ξ symbol; acceptable alternative but Kawasaki-Gunton is
    more diagnostic of the z=2 dynamic critical exponent and matches
    the `microscale → emergent` bridge label directly.

  **Honest-claude scope notes:**
  - The encoded relation is the **late-stage asymptotic** coarsening
    law, exact in the Allen-Cahn linear regime and in the scaling
    regime of the nonlinear theory; for early-time transients and
    near-critical behavior, RG corrections (logarithms, anomalous
    dimensions) are not captured.
  - The full Langevin equation — gradient flow `-Γ δH/δφ`,
    FDT-balanced δ-correlated noise `⟨ζζ⟩ = 2Γk_BT δ(x-x')δ(t-t')`,
    and Landau-Ginzburg functional `H[φ] = ∫d³x [½(∇φ)² + V(φ)]` —
    remains outside the AST. Encoding it would require three grammar
    extensions (Dirac δ, functional δ-derivative, functional
    integration over field configurations).

**Catalog coordination:**

- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` (`src/dimensional/bridge-check.ts`):
  added `[15, AREA]` with Wave-Z-D comment; AREA newly imported.
- `ENCODED_RHS` (`tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`):
  added `{ id: 15, rhs: BE15_COARSENING_LENGTH_SQUARED_RHS }`.
- Cross-check map size pin (`tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts`):
  bumped 36 → 37; updated id allowlist; commentary documents the
  OpenAI o3 consultation.
- Orphan allowlist (`tests/bridges/orphan-dimensional-signature.test.ts`):
  added 15 to `ENCODED_RHS_IDS` in numeric order.

**Counts:**

- AST encodings: 36/40 → **37/40 active modules**.
- Test suite: 1068/1068 → **1092/1092 passing**.
- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`: 36 → 37 entries.

**Remaining gaps (final state):**

- **BE-28 (MEPP)**: deferred indefinitely per OpenAI o3 Wave-Z-D
  consultation. Onsager linear-response quadratic form encoding would
  mislabel MEPP — Onsager is uncontested established physics; MEPP's
  unique content is the *variational* claim that NESS maximizes σ
  subject to constraints, which requires variational-δ + Lagrange-
  multiplier + discrete-index-sum grammar primitives. MEPP itself is
  contested (Grinstein-Linsker 2007); a canonical scalar reduction
  doesn't exist.
- **BE-16, BE-37**: `status='invalid'` by design (BE-16 algebraically
  self-refuting; BE-37 Ellis-Uzan operationally meaningless). Not
  encodable.

**Final realistic ceiling: 37/40 active AST modules** without grammar
extensions. Reaching 38/40 would require a variational δ + Lagrange-
multiplier grammar extension (for MEPP); reaching the catalog total
of 40 is impossible without changing the `status='invalid'` design
decisions for BE-16 and BE-37, both of which are documented as
permanently un-encodable per their published critiques.

### Wave Z-C — AST encoding for BE-17 (Einstein-Cartan) and BE-44 (soft hair) scalar reductions (2026-05-07)

Encodes the two remaining bridges with closed-form scalar reductions
identified in the Wave-Z OpenAI consultation. Both encode SCALAR
REDUCTIONS of operator-valued original formulas — the field equations /
BMS charge themselves cannot be expressed in the UPT AST grammar.

- **BE-17 Einstein-Cartan squared-invariant reduction**
  (`be-17-einstein-cartan.ts`): encodes
  `S²_spin = (c⁴/(8πG))² · T_λμν T^λμν` — the squared norm of the
  spin angular-momentum density tensor obtained by inverting the EC
  algebraic torsion-spin coupling `T^λ_μν = (8πG/c⁴) S^λ_μν`. The
  contraction `T_λμν T^λμν` is encoded as a single typed-stub symbol
  `T_torsion_squared` with dim `[T²·L⁻⁴]` (the AST does not expand the
  index sum); the prefactor `(c⁴/(8πG))²` as a typed-stub
  `c4_over_8piG_squared` with dim `[M²·L²·T⁻⁴]`. Inferred RHS dim
  **`[L⁻² M² T⁻²]`** = (angular-momentum-density)². `dimensional_signature`
  null → `'[L^-2 M^2 T^-2]'`. Status `'speculative'` not lifted —
  encoding does NOT promote (the EC-as-UPT-bridge framing remains
  speculative; the canonical EC equations remain unchanged).

  Refs: Cartan 1922; Hehl-vonderHeyde-Kerlick-Nester 1976 (canonical
  EC review); Trautman 2006 (modern intro, arXiv:gr-qc/0606062);
  Shapiro 2002 (torsion review, arXiv:hep-th/0103093).

  **Honest-claude scope notes:**
  - This is a SCALAR INVARIANT of the EC torsion-spin coupling, NOT
    the full field equations. The Einstein equation
    `R_μν − ½R g_μν + Λ g_μν = (8πG/c⁴) T_μν`, the metric, the
    cosmological term, and the rank-3 torsion index structure all
    remain absent from the AST.
  - The contraction-stub idiom (single typed symbol absorbing an
    unexpressible index sum) is the analog of BE-46's `exp_factor` for
    tensors. Same precedent.

- **BE-44 Soft Hair L²-norm reduction** (`be-44-soft-hair.ts`):
  encodes `Q_soft² = ∫(∂_u C)² du` — the L²-norm of the news at null
  infinity, obtained as the squared-norm of the original BMS
  supertranslation charge. Uses the AST's `integral` primitive (same
  machinery as BE-26's WKB exponent). News tensor `∂_u C` typed as
  `[velocity]` (the L²-norm conventionally interprets the asymptotic
  shear in canonical SI units); squared news `[L² T⁻²]`; integral
  over u-direction `[T]` yields **`[L² T⁻¹]`**.
  `dimensional_signature` null → `'[L^2 T^-1]'`. Status `'speculative'`
  not lifted.

  Refs: Hawking-Perry-Strominger 2016 (arXiv:1601.00921; original
  soft-hair proposal); Hawking-Perry-Strominger 2017 (arXiv:1611.09175;
  BMS supertranslation details); Bondi-vanderBurg-Metzner 1962
  (foundational BMS paper); Strominger 2014 (arXiv:1312.2229);
  Strominger 2018 lecture notes (arXiv:1703.05448).

  **Honest-claude scope notes:**
  - The original BE-44 formula
    `Q_soft^± = ∫_{𝒤^±} ∂_u C_{zz̄} Y^z dz∧dz̄` is operator-valued
    (C is a field, Y^z a BMS parameter; the celestial-2-sphere
    geometry is non-trivial). The encoded L²-reduction integrates
    only over the u-direction with the (dimensionless under
    stereographic conventions) celestial-2-sphere absorbed implicitly.
  - The BMS supertranslation parameter Y^z is dropped — the
    L²-norm extracts the integrated `(news)²` content but loses the
    BMS-charge structure.
  - Numerical evaluator uses trapezoidal quadrature (O(du²) on uniform
    grid), not exact integration. Rejects empty / sub-2 / non-finite
    samples and non-positive du.

**Catalog coordination:**

- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` (`src/dimensional/bridge-check.ts`):
  added `[17, SPIN_DENSITY_SQUARED]` and `[44, SOFT_HAIR_L2_SQUARED]`
  with local dim consts.
- `ENCODED_RHS` (`tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`):
  added BE-17 and BE-44 entries.
- Cross-check map size pin (`tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts`):
  bumped 34 → 36; updated id allowlist; added per-bridge BE-17
  positive/negative cross-check block.
- Orphan allowlist (`tests/bridges/orphan-dimensional-signature.test.ts`):
  added 17 and 44 to `ENCODED_RHS_IDS`.

**Counts:**

- AST encodings: 34/40 → **36/40 active modules**.
- Test suite: 1019/1019 → **1068/1068 passing**.
- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`: 34 → 36 entries.

**Remaining gaps (the realistic ceiling discussion):**

- **BE-15** (Hohenberg-Halperin Model A): deferred indefinitely.
  Requires grammar extensions for (a) Dirac-delta correlators
  `⟨ζζ⟩ ∝ δ(x-x')δ(t-t')`, (b) functional derivatives `δH/δφ`, and
  (c) functional integration `∫ d³x [...]` over field configurations.
  Partial scalar reductions (FDT amplitude `2Γk_BT`, MSD asymptotic)
  are dimensionally encodable but physics-losing and not canonical.
- **BE-28** (MEPP): deferred indefinitely. Requires grammar extensions
  for (a) variational δ-operator over functionals, (b) Lagrange
  multipliers, (c) discrete-index sum `Σ_i J_i X_i`. MEPP itself is a
  contested principle (Grinstein-Linsker 2007 rebuttal), so the
  canonical scalar to encode is itself unsettled.
- **BE-16, BE-37**: `status='invalid'` by design. Not encodable.
  BE-16 is algebraically self-refuting; BE-37 (VSL) is operationally
  meaningless per Ellis-Uzan 2005.

**Final state:** 36/40 active AST modules is the realistic ceiling
without grammar extensions. Reaching 38/40 would require adding
δ-correlator and variational/multiplier primitives — a substantial
grammar extension worth its own future wave.

### Wave Z-B — AST encoding for BE-25 IIT inner intrinsic information (2026-05-07)

Re-encodes BE-25 (Consciousness ↔ Information Integration) under the
Wave P-D R-D2 IIT reformulation. Wave Q B2 had archived the legacy
Penrose-Hameroff AST `be-25-orch-or.ts` when the bridge was reformulated
to IIT Φ_max; the bridge has been carrying `dimensional_signature: null`
since. Wave Z-B closes the gap with a new AST module encoding the
**inner** intrinsic-information form (the kernel the MIP minimizes).

- **BE-25 IIT inner intrinsic information** (`be-25-iit-phi.ts`):
  encodes `ii(s, s̃) = p(s̃|s) · log₂[p(s̃|s) / p(s̃)]` as DIMENSIONLESS
  via the log-stub idiom. `BE25_LOG2_FACTOR` is a fresh dimensionless
  symbol stub for `log₂(...)`; `BE25_LOG_RATIO_ARG` exposes the
  argument `p_cond / p_marg` for the per-bridge dimensionless-argument
  lemma test (same pattern as BE-45's `BE45_LOG_RATIO_ARG_MP_HINF`).
  `BE25_P_CONDITIONAL` and `BE25_P_MARGINAL` are exposed as lemma
  nodes for direct introspection. `dimensional_signature` null →
  `'[1]'`; ii has units of *bits* when log₂ is used, which is a
  pseudo-unit not in the SI 7-base system and types as DIMENSIONLESS.
  `tractability_class` retained `'numerical-asymptotic'` (Wave Q B1 —
  Φ_max is EXPTIME in substrate size, but each ii(s,s̃) evaluation is
  constant-time). Status `'speculative'` is **not lifted** — IIT
  itself is calculable, but the bridge framing (consciousness ↔
  maximally-integrated information) is contested by Aaronson 2014 and
  Doerig 2019.

  Refs: Tononi 2008; Oizumi-Albantakis-Tononi 2014 IIT 3.0;
  Albantakis et al. 2023 IIT 4.0 (arXiv:2212.14787); Aaronson 2014
  contested-framework critique; Doerig et al. 2019 unfolding-argument
  critique.

  **Honest-claude deferrals:**
  - The outer MIP minimization
    `Φ_max(S) = min_{θ ∈ partitions(S)} [ii − ii_θ]` is **deferred
    grammar-extension** — the UPT AST has no `min`-over-discrete-
    index-set primitive. Same status as BE-15 (stochastic noise) and
    BE-28 (Lagrange multipliers). Encoding the inner ii(s,s̃) kernel
    resolves the dimensional-signature gap; encoding the full Φ_max
    requires extending the AST grammar with a `min` primitive.
  - The partition-conditional `ii_θ(s, s̃)` lemma is not encoded
    (deferred with the MIP).

  **User-confirmed design choice:** the numerical evaluator
  `evaluateIntrinsicInformation` enforces Shannon's
  `0 · log(0/anything) = 0` limit (the canonical
  Oizumi-Albantakis-Tononi 2014 convention) and rejects the
  KL-divergence singularity `p_cond > 0 with p_marg = 0`
  (impossible-joint-event) with RangeError. Confirmed via
  `AskUserQuestion` before encoding.

  The legacy Penrose-Hameroff AST module `be-25-orch-or.ts` remains
  archived (Wave Q B2) for historical traceability. Its archive-
  regression test `tests/bridges/be-25-encoding.test.ts` was updated
  to pin the new `dimensional_signature: '[1]'`. New test file
  `tests/bridges/be-25-iit-encoding.test.ts` covers 26 cases (index
  invariants, dimensional validation, numerical evaluation with
  edge cases, input validation).

**Catalog coordination:**

- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` (`src/dimensional/bridge-check.ts`):
  add `[25, DIMENSIONLESS]` with Wave-Z-B comment.
- `ENCODED_RHS` (`tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`):
  add `{ id: 25, rhs: BE25_INTRINSIC_INFORMATION_RHS }`.
- Cross-check map size pin (`tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts`):
  bumped 33 → 34; updated id allowlist; removed legacy
  `has(25) === false` sentinel.
- Orphan allowlist (`tests/bridges/orphan-dimensional-signature.test.ts`):
  BE-25 was already in `ENCODED_RHS_IDS` (placeholder from earlier
  wave); no edit needed.

**Counts:**

- AST encodings: 33/40 → **34/40 active modules** (Wave Z-A 33 + BE-25
  Wave Z-B 1).
- Test suite: 992/992 → **1019/1019 passing**.
- `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`: 33 → 34 entries.

**Remaining gaps:**

- Wave Z-C (next): BE-17 Einstein-Cartan quadratic invariant
  `S² = (c⁴/(8πG))² · T_λμν T^λμν` (typed energy-density-squared dim);
  BE-44 supertranslation soft-hair charge
  `Q_soft² = ∫(∂_u C)² dμ` via integral primitive.
- Realistic ceiling: 36/40 after Wave Z-C lands; 38/40 if BE-15
  stochastic-noise grammar extension and BE-28 Lagrange-multiplier
  grammar extension are added in a future wave.
- Excluded by design: BE-16 algebraically self-refuting, BE-37
  Ellis-Uzan operationally-meaningless. Both remain `status='invalid'`.

### Wave Z-A — AST encoding for 4 OpenAI-proposed dimensionless reductions (2026-05-07)

Pre-Wave-Z status: 29/40 bridges AST-encoded (Wave Y). The remaining 11
were dispositioned as: 8 "truly unencodable" (BE-15, 17, 28, 32, 35, 44,
46, 50), 2 status='invalid' by design (BE-16, BE-37), and BE-25 IIT
(deferred — encodable as inner ii-form but the MIP `min` is grammar-
extending).

For the 8 unencodable bridges, OpenAI (o3-mini) proposed scalar reductions;
Gemini-Pro independently confirmed the proposals after the
mcp-host:llm-gemini server's max_output_tokens / thinking-budget bug was
patched in `llm-providers-mcp@5440ad6`. Wave Z-A applies the 4 simplest
DIMENSIONLESS reductions; Wave Z-B (BE-25 IIT) and Wave Z-C (BE-17
quadratic invariant + BE-44 supertranslation charge integral) follow.
BE-15 and BE-28 remain deferred — both require grammar extensions
(stochastic noise; Lagrange multipliers).

- **BE-32 Quantum Reference Frames**: original integral form
  `|ψ⟩_B = ∫ dg U(g) |ψ⟩_A ⊗ |g⟩_frame` is operator-valued and formally
  divergent for non-compact groups. Encoded scalar reduction (Wave Z):
  the Born-rule overlap probability
  `P_overlap = |⟨ψ_A|U(g)|ψ_B⟩|² = c² + s²` for a single (implicit)
  group element g. New module
  `src/bridges/equations/be-32-quantum-reference-frame.ts` with `c²`
  and `s²` lemma exports, `evaluateQRFOverlap` numerical evaluator
  (Born-rule `> 1+ε` guard), and `validateBE32Dimensions`.
  `dimensional_signature` null → `'[1]'`. `tractability_class` lifted
  `'formally-divergent'` → `'closed-form'`.
  Refs: Giacomini-Castro-Ruiz-Brukner 2019; Vanrietvelde et al. 2020;
  Bartlett-Rudolph-Spekkens 2007.

- **BE-35 Conformal Bootstrap**: original 4-pt-function expansion
  `⟨O₁O₂O₃O₄⟩ = Σ_{Δ,ℓ} C₁₂^O C₃₄^O g_{Δ,ℓ}(u,v)` is operator-valued.
  Encoded reduction: crossing-symmetry residual
  `R_cross = C²·[g_block(u,v) − g_block(v,u)]` which is identically zero
  at the crossing-symmetric point u=v=1/4 for any consistent CFT. New
  module `src/bridges/equations/be-35-conformal-bootstrap.ts` with
  forward and crossed-block lemmas, `evaluateCrossingResidual`, and
  `validateBE35Dimensions`. `dimensional_signature` null → `'[1]'`.
  Honest-claude scope: single-block reduction (real bootstrap sums
  infinite (Δ,ℓ) tower with positivity / unitarity constraints — that
  spectrum-fitting is the load-bearing numerical content of bootstrap
  papers and is NOT captured here); conformal-block functions encoded
  as dimensionless symbol stubs (no hypergeometric-function AST node).
  Refs: Rattazzi-Rychkov-Tonni-Vichi 2008; Poland-Rychkov-Vichi 2019;
  Dolan-Osborn 2001; Kos-Poland-Simmons-Duffin 2014.

- **BE-46 Multiverse Measure Problem**: original path-integral form
  `P[O] = ∫dμ[g,φ] W[g,φ] δ(O − O[g,φ])` is formally divergent (the
  measure problem is the entry's own subject). Encoded scalar reduction
  (Wave Z): the Weinberg-Vilenkin anthropic probability
  `P(Λ) = A · exp(−α/Λ)` for a cosmological-constant-like landscape
  parameter Λ. New module
  `src/bridges/equations/be-46-multiverse-measure.ts` with exp-argument
  lemma (`(0 − α)/Λ` dimensionless), exp-factor stub, normalization,
  `evaluateWeinbergVilenkinP` (rejects Λ ≤ 0), and
  `validateBE46Dimensions`. `dimensional_signature` null → `'[1]'`.
  `tractability_class` lifted `'formally-divergent'` → `'closed-form'`
  for the encoded scalar; original path-integral form remains formally
  divergent (the 'highly-speculative' status reflects this and is NOT
  lifted by the AST encoding — pinning a Tier-5 AST does not promote
  the bridge framing). Refs: Vilenkin 1995; Weinberg 1987; Linde-Linde-
  Mezhlumian 1994; Garriga-Vilenkin 2001; Freivogel 2011.

- **BE-50 Wheeler-Feynman absorber**: Wave P-A canonical form
  `A_μ(x) = (1/2)[A_μ^ret(x) + A_μ^adv(x)]` preserved in formula_latex.
  Encoded scalar reduction (Wave Z): time-symmetry residual
  `r_TS = (A_ret − A_adv)/(A_ret + A_adv)` — vanishes identically (≡ 0)
  under the absorber boundary condition. New module
  `src/bridges/equations/be-50-wheeler-feynman.ts` with `A_ret`, `A_adv`
  pinned to magnetic-vector-potential dim `{L:1, M:1, T:-2, I:-1}` (V·s/m);
  numerator / denominator / residual lemma exports;
  `evaluateWFTimeSymmetry` (rejects denominator = 0); and
  `validateBE50Dimensions`. `dimensional_signature` null → `'[1]'`.
  `tractability_class` lifted `'numerical-tractable'` → `'closed-form'`.
  Status remains 'highly-speculative' (absorber boundary condition
  empirically untested in QFT). Refs: Wheeler-Feynman 1945, 1949;
  Cramer 1986; Hoyle-Narlikar 1995.

- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended** with `[32, DIMENSIONLESS]`,
  `[35, DIMENSIONLESS]`, `[46, DIMENSIONLESS]`, `[50, DIMENSIONLESS]`.
  Map size pin: 29 → 33.

- **`tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`** ENCODED_RHS
  entries added for BE-32, 35, 46, 50; round-trip
  `format(infer(rhs)) === entry.dimensional_signature` now covers 33
  encoded modules.

- **AST encoding count**: 29 → **33** active modules. Remaining encodable
  bridges: BE-25 (Wave Z-B), BE-17 (Wave Z-C quadratic invariant), BE-44
  (Wave Z-C supertranslation-charge integral). BE-15 (stochastic) and
  BE-28 (Lagrange-multiplier stationarity) remain deferred as
  grammar-extending. BE-16 and BE-37 remain status='invalid' by design
  (algebraically self-refuting / operationally meaningless per
  Ellis-Uzan 2005); they are NOT candidates for AST encoding.

- **External LLM second-opinion validation**: OpenAI o3-mini proposed
  the 8 reductions; Gemini 2.5 Pro independently confirmed all 4
  Wave-Z-A reductions as physically meaningful and AST-grammar-compliant
  (verdicts captured in per-bridge `notes` fields).

### Wave Y — BE-17 deferred (honest-claude documented defer; 2026-05-07)
- **BE-17 (Einstein-Cartan torsion-spin coupling) reformulation deferred** in Wave Y. The Einstein-Cartan equations have rank-3 torsion `T^λ_μν` and rank-3 spin-density `S^λ_μν` tensor structures whose canonical scalar reductions all require committing to a specific spin-source profile that goes beyond what a Wave-Y-style "trace and encode" reformulation can defensibly do without research-level physics judgment:
  - The naive trace `T_α := T^αβ_β = (8πG/c⁴) S^αβ_β` is canonical only for specific spin-source models (e.g., Dirac fields), not as a general EC identity.
  - The vacuum-spinless limit (`S = 0`) collapses EC to vacuum GR (`R = 4Λ`), which would make BE-17 identical to BE-13's vacuum case — duplicative.
  - Encoding `|T|² = (8πG/c⁴)² |S|²` as a scalar magnitude relation requires choosing an `|S|²` definition (Killing vs Frobenius vs Hodge norm) which is a framework decision.
- **Per the Wave Y task spec's honest-claude defer clause** ("if any of the 11 reformulations turns out to require physics judgment beyond the canonical-form choice (e.g., BE-17 EC trace if it gets too messy), defer that one with a documented honest note. Don't force."), BE-17 is left at its current Wave P-B R-B3 reformulated state (Einstein-Cartan field equations + algebraic torsion-spin coupling preserved as the canonical formula_latex; dimensional_signature null; tractability_class numerical-tractable). The Wave Y AST-encoding of BE-17 is deferred to a future wave that commits to a specific spin-source profile (e.g., Dirac torsion BE-17a, Maxwell-torsion BE-17b separate entries).

### Wave Y — BE-36 reformulated to GW170817 graviton-speed bound + Tier-5 AST encoding (2026-05-07)
- **BE-36 reformulated**: replaced the operator-valued TeVeS action `S = S_g + S_φ + S_A + S_matter` (Bekenstein 2004; AST-unencodable without committing to a bulk geometry) with the canonical GW170817 dimensionless graviton-photon speed bound `|c_GW − c|/c ≤ 10⁻¹⁵` (Abbott et al. 2017 *ApJ Lett.* 848:L13, arXiv:1710.05832; Boran et al. 2018 *Phys. Rev. D* 97:041501). The TeVeS framework is preserved as bridge framing.
- **BE-36 encoded as 29th active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-36-gw-speed-bound.ts`. Form: signed dimensionless ratio `(c_GW − c)/c`, with absolute-value bound check via `satisfiesGW170817Bound` numerical helper. SI dimension: `[1]`. `GW170817_SPEED_BOUND` constant exported as 1e-15.
- **Bracket-checks**: GR limit (c_GW = c) → ratio = 0; small deviations within bound → satisfiesBound = true; deviations at 10⁻¹⁰ scale → fail bound; signed-symmetric (positive and negative deviations both checked); linearity at small Δ.
- **`tractability_class` lifted** 'numerical-tractable' → 'closed-form'.
- **17-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip, dimensional structure, 8 numerical bracket-checks, 2 input-validation tests.
- **`be-36-reformulation.test.ts` updated**: TeVeS-action assertions replaced with GW170817-bound assertions; tractability_class assertion changed.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[36, DIMENSIONLESS]`. Map size pin 28 → 29.
- **29 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49.

### Wave Y — BE-27 reformulated to Cugliandolo-Kurchan effective-temperature scalar + Tier-5 AST encoding (2026-05-07)
- **BE-27 reformulated**: replaced the operator-valued FDT-violation correlator `χ(ω) = (1/(k_BT_eff(ω))) ∫dt e^iωt ⟨δF δx⟩ + Σ_active(ω)` with the canonical Cugliandolo-Kurchan scalar effective temperature `T_eff = T·(1 + Σ_active/(k_B T))` (Cugliandolo-Kurchan 1993 *J. Phys. A* 26:L401; Cugliandolo 2011 review). Full FDT-violation correlator preserved as bridge framing.
- **BE-27 encoded as 28th active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-27-effective-temperature.ts`. Form: `T_eff = T · (1 + Σ_active/(k_B T))`. SI dimension: `[temperature]`. Bracket: passive equilibrium (Σ_active=0) → T_eff = T; Σ_active = k_B T → T_eff = 2T; linearity in Σ_active.
- **`tractability_class` lifted** 'numerical-tractable' → 'closed-form'.
- **18-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip, dimensional structure, 7 numerical bracket-checks (passive limit, k_BT-scaling, linearity, cooling regime with negative Σ, identity, T-rescaling), 2 input-validation tests.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[27, TEMPERATURE]`. Map size pin 27 → 28.
- **28 active AST encodings** total.

### Wave Y — BE-18 reformulated to Higgs-like Yukawa-VEV mass + Tier-5 AST encoding (2026-05-07)
- **BE-18 reformulated**: replaced the full non-Abelian dark-sector Lagrangian density `L_dark = -(1/4)G^a G^aμν + |D_μΦ|² + ψ̄(...)ψ - V(|Φ|)` (rank-2 tensor + spinor structure unencoded by AST validator; dim_sig was [L^8 M^4 T^-8] = energy^4) with the canonical scalar Yukawa-VEV mass-generation relation `m_dark = g_dark · v_dark` (Peskin-Schroeder §20.1 textbook fermion-mass mechanism). Full Lagrangian preserved as bridge framing / context.
- **BE-18 encoded as 27th active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-18-higgs-mass.ts`. Form: `m_dark = g_dark · v_dark`. SI dimension changed `[L^8 M^4 T^-8]` (Lagrangian density) → `[energy]` (mass in natural units, particle-physics convention). Bracket: SM top-quark m_t ≈ 173 GeV with y_t ≈ 0.99, v_EW = 246 GeV/√2 = 174 GeV → m_t = 0.99·174 ≈ 172 GeV ✓ within 1% of measured value; SM electron y_e ≈ 2.94e-6 → m_e ≈ 0.511 MeV.
- **`tractability_class` lifted** 'numerical-tractable' → 'closed-form'.
- **17-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip (status, formula_latex pinning m·g·v form and absence of Lagrangian tokens, Peskin-Schroeder reference), dimensional structure, 8 numerical bracket-checks (SM top, SM electron, zero-coupling/zero-VEV, linearity in g/v, full identity, signed coupling), 2 input-validation tests.
- **`be-18-fix.test.ts` updated** from R1-audit-era Lagrangian-form regression to Wave Y archive (formula_latex now scalar mass relation; full Lagrangian assertions removed).
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[18, ENERGY]`. Map size pin 26 → 27. `ORPHAN_DIMENSIONAL_SIGNATURES` reduced from {18} to {} — all dimensional_signatures now AST-backed. Direction-1 test gets a sentinel `expect(ORPHAN_DIMENSIONAL_SIGNATURES.size).toBe(0)` since the for-loop over an empty set produces no test.
- **27 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49.

### Wave Y — BE-30 FLM first-law encoded as Tier-5 AST module (2026-05-07)
- **BE-30 encoded as 26th active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-30-flm-first-law.ts`. Form: `δS_EE(R) = δ⟨H_R⟩` (FLM linear-response identity, Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena 2013 *JHEP* 11:074, arXiv:1307.2892). SI dimension: `[1]` (dimensionless, nats convention).
- **Honest-claude tautology disclosure**: the FLM identity is tautological at the linear-response level (δS_EE/δ⟨H_R⟩ = 1 by construction). The encoding pins the dimensional structure and the scalar relation; the bracket-check tests verify only the trivial linear-response identity, not a non-trivial physical prediction.
- **Bekenstein bound secondary cross-check**: `evaluateBekensteinBound({R_m, E_J})` returns `S ≤ 2π R E / (ℏc)` (Bekenstein 1981 *Phys. Rev. D* 23:287) as a non-trivial physical magnitude check. 1 J in 1 m region → ≈2×10²⁶ nats upper bound.
- **`tractability_class` lifted** 'numerical-tractable' → 'closed-form'.
- **15-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip, dimensional structure, 3 FLM linear-response checks (tautology, equilibrium, linearity), 4 Bekenstein bound checks (textbook magnitude, R-linearity, E-linearity, positivity), 3 input-validation tests.
- **`be-30-reformulation.test.ts` updated** for the lifted tractability_class.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[30, DIMENSIONLESS]`. Map size pin 25 → 26.
- **26 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49.

### Wave Y — BE-13 reformulated to scalar trace of Einstein equations + Tier-5 AST encoding (2026-05-07)
- **BE-13 reformulated**: replaced the full tensor Einstein equation `R_μν - (1/2)R g_μν + Λ g_μν = (8πG/c⁴) T_μν` (rank-2 tensor structure unencoded by the AST validator) with its canonical scalar trace `R = 4Λ - (8πG/c⁴) T` (g^μν contraction; MTW §17.4; Carroll §4.7). The Jacobson 1995 thermodynamic-origin information-physics framing is preserved as the bridge framing; the trace is the AST-encodable scalar.
- **BE-13 encoded as 25th active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-13-einstein-trace.ts`. Form: `R = 4Λ - (8πG/c⁴)T`. SI dimension: `[L^-2]` (Ricci scalar; same as BE-31). Hand-built `RICCI_SCALAR_DIM` literal (not `power(LENGTH, -2)`) to avoid the `-0` deep-equality issue (same pattern as BE-23 RESISTIVITY, BE-31 INV_LENGTH_2).
- **`tractability_class` lifted** 'numerical-tractable' → 'closed-form' (the trace is a single algebraic relation given (Λ, T)).
- **15-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip (status, formula_latex, Wave Y notes), dimensional structure, 7 numerical bracket-checks (vacuum R=0, pure-CC R=4Λ, matter-dominance T·c² scaling, linearity in Λ and T independently, superposition R(Λ,T) = R(Λ,0) + R(0,T), full algebraic identity), 2 input-validation tests.
- **`be-13-reformulation.test.ts` updated**: formula_latex assertion broadened to accept either tensor or scalar form (both content-equivalent under contraction); tractability_class assertion changed 'numerical-tractable' → 'closed-form'.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[13, INV_LENGTH_2]` (reuses the BE-31 literal). Map size pin 24 → 25.
- **25 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49.

### Wave Y — BE-20 reformulated to observed cosmological-constant mass density + Tier-5 AST encoding (2026-05-07)
- **BE-20 reformulated**: replaced the formally-divergent vacuum-fluctuation integral `ρ_vac = ρ_0 + ∫d³k (ℏω_k/2)·ζ(k/k_UV)` (which produces the famous 10¹²⁰-discrepancy cosmological-constant problem) with the canonical FRW observed-CC relation `ρ_Λ = c²Λ/(8πG)` (Carroll 2001 *Living Rev. Relativity* 4:1, arXiv:astro-ph/0004075). The cosmological-constant problem itself is preserved as the famous unfixed problem in known_issues; the Wave Y reformulation does NOT solve it, only encodes the observed scalar that the problem is *about*.
- **BE-20 encoded as 24th active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-20-vacuum-energy.ts`. Form: `ρ_Λ = c²Λ/(8πG)`. SI dimension: `[L^-3 M]` (mass density, kg/m³; `[c²Λ] = T⁻²` and `[1/G] = MT²L⁻³`, product = ML⁻³). Default Λ = 1.1×10⁻⁵² m⁻² (Planck 2018).
- **Bracket-check**: with default Λ, ρ_Λ ≈ 5.9×10⁻²⁷ kg/m³ matching the observed dark-energy mass density (~70% of present-day critical density). Energy-density form ρ_Λc² ≈ 7×10⁻¹⁰ J/m³ recoverable as the alternate convention.
- **`tractability_class` lifted** from 'formally-divergent' to 'closed-form' (the observed-CC form is a single algebraic relation given Λ).
- **20-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip (status, formula_latex pinning Λ/c²/(8πG) form and absence of ∫d³k integral, Carroll/Planck references, CC problem preserved in known_issues), dimensional structure, 7 numerical bracket-checks (canonical Planck 2018 value, Λ=0 zero-density, linearity in Λ, algebraic identity, positivity, energy-density alternate ≈7×10⁻¹⁰ J/m³), 2 input-validation tests.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[20, MASS_DENSITY]` (new `[L^-3 M]` literal in bridge-check.ts). Map size pin 23 → 24.
- **References overhauled**: dropped off-topic arXiv:1402.5674 / 1509.07876 (Susskind complexity-volume; not BE-20 content); added Carroll 2001 review, Weinberg 1989 CC problem, Planck 2020 measurement, Riess 1998 / Perlmutter 1999 supernova-acceleration.
- **24 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49.

### Wave Y — BE-48 reformulated to canonical mass-amplified GRW rate + Tier-5 AST encoding (2026-05-07)
- **BE-48 reformulated**: replaced the full GRW Lindblad master equation `dρ/dt = -(i/ℏ)[H,ρ] + λ ∫d³x [L_x ρ L_x† - (1/2){L_x† L_x, ρ}]` (operator-valued, no clean scalar AST encoding) with the canonical CSL mass-amplified scalar localization rate `λ_GRW(m) = λ_0 · (m/m_0)`. The Lindblad master equation is preserved as the bridge framing / context; the scalar rate is the AST-encoded bridge content (parallel to BE-11 encoding only the Caldeira-Leggett rate γ_k(λ), not the full Lindblad master equation).
- **Status downgraded** 'established' → 'speculative': consistent with the BE-22 / BE-26 / BE-38 precedent (canonical math, bridge framing speculative). The rate formula is canonical CSL physics; using GRW / CSL mass-amplification as a UPT quantum-foundations bridge is the speculative element.
- **BE-48 encoded as 23rd active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-48-grw-localization.ts`. Form: `λ_GRW(m) = λ_0 · (m/m_0)`. SI dimension: `[frequency]` (was orphan; now AST-backed). λ_0 default = 1×10⁻¹⁶ /s (canonical 1986 GRW value); m_0 default = nucleon mass 1.67×10⁻²⁷ kg.
- **Bracket-checks**: single-nucleon m=m_0 → λ=λ_0; electron → ≈5×10⁻²⁰ /s; macroscopic 1 g → ≈6×10⁷ /s (rapid collapse, no Schrödinger-cat states).
- **18-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip (status 'speculative', formula_latex, references, notes), dimensional structure, 8 numerical bracket-checks (single-nucleon textbook, electron, macroscopic-rapid-collapse, linearity in m / m_0 / λ_0, λ_0=0 zero-rate), 4 input-validation tests.
- **`be-48-fix.test.ts` updated** from R0-audit-era Lindblad-form regression to Wave Y archive: assertions pin the post-reformulation scalar-rate form while preserving R0-audit history (GRW 1986 references retained). Status assertion changed 'established' → 'speculative'.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[48, FREQUENCY]`. Map size pin 22 → 23. `ORPHAN_DIMENSIONAL_SIGNATURES` reduced from {18, 48} to {18}.
- **23 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49.

### Wave Y — BE-42 reformulated to canonical Hawking temperature + Tier-5 AST encoding (2026-05-07)
- **BE-42 reformulated**: replaced the firewall complement-principle quantum-state superposition `|ψ⟩ = α|smooth⟩ + β|firewall⟩` (an AST-unencodable Hilbert-space decomposition without operational predictive content) with the canonical Hawking 1975 temperature `T_H = ℏc³/(8π G M k_B)` — the temperature scale at which the firewall paradox lives. The bridge framing (firewall paradox / information paradox resolutions) is preserved as the speculative element documented in known_issues.
- **BE-42 encoded as 22nd active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-42-hawking-temperature.ts`. Form: `T_H = ℏc³/(8π G M k_B)`. SI dimension: `[temperature]`. Numerical bracket: solar-mass BH (M ≈ 1.989×10³⁰ kg) → T_H ≈ 6.17×10⁻⁸ K (textbook Hawking temperature for stellar-mass BH per Wald §14.3.7).
- **18-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip (status 'highly-speculative', formula_latex, references, notes), dimensional structure (LHS/RHS [temperature]), 8 numerical bracket-checks (solar-mass textbook value, inverse-mass scaling at multiple factors, Planck-mass T_H/T_Planck = 1/(8π) algebraic identity, supermassive-BH ~10⁻¹⁷ K, mini-BH evaporation regime, full algebraic identity, positivity), 2 input-validation tests.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[42, TEMPERATURE]`. Map size pin 21 → 22.
- **22 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 49.

### Wave Y — BE-29 reformulated to canonical Jarzynski free-energy equality + Tier-5 AST encoding (2026-05-07)
- **BE-29 reformulated**: replaced the curved-spacetime gravity-extension form `⟨exp(-βW)⟩ = exp(-βΔF) · exp(-(β/2c⁴) ∫T^μν δg_μν √(-g) d⁴x)` (gravity-correction integral is operator-valued + AST-unencodable) with the canonical Jarzynski 1997 equality `ΔF = -k_B T ln⟨exp(-W/(k_B T))⟩`. The bridge framing (Jarzynski extension to gravitational work, the original BE-29 motivation) is preserved as the speculative element documented in known_issues; the pure Jarzynski equality is the canonical scalar bridge content. Status remains 'speculative' (gravity-extension framing is the speculative element).
- **BE-29 encoded as 21st active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-29-jarzynski.ts`. Form: `ΔF = -k_B T · ln⟨exp(-βW)⟩`. SI dimension: `[energy]` (was orphan; now backed by AST). Numerical evaluator estimates ⟨exp(-βW)⟩ from a sample of work values; bracket-checks include the equilibrium identity `ΔF = W_rev` when all samples are at the reversible work value.
- **Exp/ln stub pattern** (same as BE-26, BE-41, BE-45): `⟨exp(-βW)⟩` is encoded as a single dimensionless symbol stub `'ln_avg_exp_minus_betaW'`; the exp argument `β·W = W/(k_B T)` is exposed as a separate ExprNode (`BE29_BETAW_ARG`) for direct dimensionlessness verification.
- **20-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip, dimensional structure (LHS/RHS [energy], exp-arg lemma dimensionless), 7 numerical bracket-checks (reversible-work limit `ΔF = W_rev`, constant-work invariant, zero-work identity, Jensen inequality `ΔF ≤ ⟨W⟩` second-law constraint, T-scaling at fixed β·W, shift linearity), 3 input-validation tests.
- **`be-29-fix.test.ts` updated** from R1-audit-era gravity-form regression (Hilbert action variation, √(-g), T^μν tokens) to Wave Y archive: assertions now pin the post-reformulation pure-Jarzynski form while preserving the audit-trail history (R1 audit notes, MTW/Wald references retained as historical gravity-extension framing context).
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[29, ENERGY]`. Map size pin 20 → 21. `ORPHAN_DIMENSIONAL_SIGNATURES` reduced from {18, 29, 48} to {18, 48} since BE-29 now has an AST module. Catalog round-trip + orphan-signature tests updated accordingly.
- **21 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49.

### Wave Y — BE-21 reformulated to KSS viscosity-to-entropy bound + Tier-5 AST encoding (2026-05-07)
- **BE-21 reformulated**: replaced the operator-valued holographic-dictionary retarded Green's function recipe `G_R = -i lim r^(2Δ-d) (g^rr/√g^tt) ∂_r φ / φ_0` (no clean scalar AST encoding without bulk-dual commitment) with the canonical Kovtun-Son-Starinets 2005 saturating value `η/s = ℏ/(4π k_B)` (arXiv:hep-th/0405231). The bridge framing (universal viscosity bound as a UPT condensed-matter ↔ high-energy bridge) is preserved; the operator-valued framing is the AST-unencodable element documented as the reformulation candidate in known_issues. Status remains 'established' (KSS itself is established AdS/CFT result).
- **BE-21 encoded as 20th active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-21-kss-bound.ts`. Form: `η/s = ℏ/(4π k_B)`. SI dimension: `[T Theta]` (K·s; ratio of viscosity [Pa·s] to entropy density [J/(K·m³)]). Numerical value: ≈6.078e-13 K·s.
- **18-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip (status, formula_latex, references, notes), dimensional structure, 8 numerical bracket-checks (canonical KSS textbook value ≈6.078e-13 K·s, algebraic identity, positivity/finiteness, hand-derived consistency, AST structure pinning).
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[21, TIME_TIMES_TEMPERATURE]` (new `[T Θ]` literal in bridge-check.ts). Map size pin 19 → 20. Catalog round-trip + orphan-signature tests extended.
- **Honest-claude bracket-check finding**: original spec doc proposed ≈8e-13 K·s as the universal lower bound; correct value is ℏ/(4π k_B) ≈ 6.078e-13 K·s (factor ~1.3 difference vs. the 8e-13 estimate; both are in the same order of magnitude). The numerical evaluator and tests pin the exact CODATA-2018 value.
- **20 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 31, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49.

### Wave X — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-39 asymptotic safety (2026-05-07)
- **BE-39 β_g encoded as 19th active AST module** at `src/bridges/equations/be-39-asymptotic-safety.ts`. Form: `β_g = 2g + A·g² + B·g³ − C·g²·λ` with all symbols dimensionless (the β-functions of dimensionless couplings are themselves dimensionless). Both LHS (β_g) and RHS infer to DIMENSIONLESS; `dimensional_signature` set to `'[1]'`. Companion β_λ = -2λ + Dλ² - Egλ - Fg² has the same dimensional structure and is numerically evaluable separately via `evaluateBetaLambda`.
- **Reuter-Weyer canonical EH-truncation coefficients** are documented as scheme-dependent in the module docstring; the AST symbol stubs (A, B, C, D, E, F) are preserved as dimensionless symbols rather than fixed numerics, matching the schematic-coefficient convention pinned in the BE-39 known_issues.
- **20-test encoding spec**: catalog round-trip, dimensional structure, 8 numerical bracket-checks (Gaussian fixed-point β_g(0,0) = β_λ(0,0) = 0 to 14 digits; linear response β_g ≈ 2g, β_λ ≈ -2λ near origin to 8 digits; closed-form polynomial agreement at (g,λ)=(0.1, 0.1) to 14 digits; -F·g² isolated contribution; A-coefficient linearity; λ-monotonicity verifying the C-sign convention), 3 input-validation tests.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended**: `[39, DIMENSIONLESS]`. Map size pin 18 → 19. Catalog round-trip test extended with BE-39. Orphan-signature test set updated.
- **19 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 23, 24, 26, 31, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49.


### Wave W — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-31 Benincasa-Dowker discrete Ricci scalar (Encoded 2026-05-07)
- **BE-31 Causal Set Continuum Limit (BD d=4 discrete Ricci scalar) encoded as 18th active Tier-5 AST module** (`src/bridges/equations/be-31-causal-set-bd.ts`). Exports `BE31_CAUSAL_SET_BD_RHS: ExprNode`, `BE31_CAUSAL_SET_BD_LHS`, `evaluateBenincasaDowker({N_0, N_1, N_2, N_3, l_P_m})`, and `validateBE31Dimensions()`.
- **Form**: `R(p) = (4/√6) · ℓ_P^(-2) · [1 + N_0(p) - 9 N_1(p) + 16 N_2(p) - 8 N_3(p)]` (d=4). SI dimension: `[L^-2]` (inverse-area; Ricci scalar). The `(4/√6)` and N_k coefficients are dimension-specific (Benincasa-Dowker 2010); d≠4 generalization requires re-deriving them.
- **Encoding pattern**: dimensionless prefactor `4/√6` and dimensionless polynomial bracket `[1 + N_0 - 9N_1 + 16N_2 - 8N_3]` bundled into a single dimensionless symbol stub multiplied by `ℓ_P^(-2)` (no spurious AST structure for the bracket coefficients). Numerical evaluator computes the bracket explicitly with full coefficient fidelity.
- **Bracket-checks** (19-test encoding spec): all-zero N_k gives `R = (4/√6) · ℓ_P^(-2)` to 12-digit ratio; algebraic-zero point at `(N_0, N_1, N_2, N_3) = (-1, 0, 0, 0)` gives `R = 0` exactly; coefficient extraction at all four unit-vector tuples ((1,0,0,0)→`(4/√6)·2·ℓ_P^-2`; (0,1,0,0)→`(4/√6)·(-8)·ℓ_P^-2`; (0,0,1,0)→`(4/√6)·17·ℓ_P^-2`; (0,0,0,1)→`(4/√6)·(-7)·ℓ_P^-2`); linearity in N_0 holding others zero; (1,1,1,1) → `(4/√6) · 1 · ℓ_P^-2` (bracket = 1+1-9+16-8 = 1); ℓ_P^(-2) scaling (doubling ℓ_P quarters R); 4 input-validation tests. The Minkowski-sprinkling continuum-limit-mean check is intentionally omitted (sensitive to BD's specific sign conventions, not a clean cross-check at the encoding level — flagged in the docstring).
- **BE-31 dimensional_signature updated** `null` → `'[L^-2]'`. AST round-trips through validator to `[L^-2]`.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` cross-check map**: added `[31, INV_LENGTH_2]` (with new `INV_LENGTH_2 = power(LENGTH, -2)` literal in bridge-check.ts; same pattern as `T_INV2` for BE-19). Map size pin updated 17 → 18.
- **Hand-built `INV_LENGTH_2` literal** in the AST module (rather than `power(LENGTH, -2)`) because `power()` produces `-0` on unaffected bases, which compares unequal under deep-strict equality even though dimensionally identical. Same pattern as BE-23's RESISTIVITY literal.
- **Catalog round-trip + orphan-signature tests extended**: `ENCODED_RHS` array += BE-31; `ENCODED_RHS_IDS` set += 31.
- **18 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 23, 24, 26, 31, 33, 34, 38, 40, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49. **Wave W complete.**



### Wave W — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-45 Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture bound (Encoded 2026-05-07)
- **BE-45 TCC e-fold bound encoded as 17th active Tier-5 AST module** (`src/bridges/equations/be-45-tcc.ts`). Exports `BE45_TCC_RHS: ExprNode`, `BE45_TCC_LHS`, `BE45_LOG_RATIO_ARG_MP_HINF` (lemma), `BE45_LOG_RATIO_ARG_R` (lemma), `evaluateTCC({M_P_GeV, H_inf_GeV, r, gamma})`, and `validateBE45Dimensions()`.
- **Form**: `N_e_max = log(M_P/H_inf) - γ · log(r/0.01)`. Encoded in **natural units** (M_P and H_inf both as ENERGY symbols) — TCC literature works in natural units throughout (ℏ = c = 1; M_P/H_inf is then a dimensionless ratio). The honest-claude resolution: the SI ratio `M_P [kg] / H_inf [1/T] = [kg·s]` would NOT be dimensionless, so the natural-units convention is mandatory and explicitly documented.
- **Encoding pattern**: dimensionless-stub for `log()` (the AST has no log primitive), with **TWO** log arguments exposed as separate ExprNodes (`BE45_LOG_RATIO_ARG_MP_HINF` and `BE45_LOG_RATIO_ARG_R`) for direct dimensionlessness verification — same pattern as BE-26 exp(-WKB) and BE-41 exp(...).
- **Bracket-checks** (17-test encoding spec): canonical TCC `M_P = 1.22e19 GeV, H_inf = 1e14 GeV (GUT-scale), r = 0.01, γ = 0 → N_e_max = ln(1.22e5) ≈ 11.71` (textbook 12-e-fold observation window) to 12 digits; reference value `r = 0.01` zeros the γ-correction; `N_e_max` increases as M_P/H_inf increases (lower-energy inflation allows more e-folds); `N_e_max` decreases as γ·log(r/0.01) increases (larger r ⇒ stronger constraint); hand-computed `M_P/H_inf = e → N = 1` to 14 digits; γ-linearity to 12 digits; 4 input-validation tests.
- **BE-45 dimensional_signature updated** `null` → `'[1]'`. AST round-trips through validator to `[1]`.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` cross-check map**: added `[45, DIMENSIONLESS]`. Map size pin updated 16 → 17. `tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts` size assertion + member list updated.
- **Catalog round-trip + orphan-signature tests extended**: `ENCODED_RHS` array += BE-45; `ENCODED_RHS_IDS` set += 45.
- **17 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 23, 24, 26, 33, 34, 38, 40, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49.



### Wave W — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-49 Quantum Darwinism mutual-information decay (Encoded 2026-05-07)
- **BE-49 Quantum Darwinism mutual-information decay encoded as 16th active Tier-5 AST module** (`src/bridges/equations/be-49-quantum-darwinism.ts`). Exports `BE49_QUANTUM_DARWINISM_RHS: ExprNode`, `BE49_QUANTUM_DARWINISM_LHS`, `evaluateQuantumDarwinism({I_SE, alpha, k, beta})`, and `validateBE49Dimensions()`.
- **Form**: `I(S:F_k) = I(S:E) - α · k^(-β)`. The spec form `I(S:F_k) = I(S:E) - O(k^-α)` is asymptotic-O notation, not a precise formula; the AST commits to the leading-order power-law correction. Spec's overloaded "α" (which denoted the exponent) is renamed to **β = decay exponent**, with **α = dimensionless magnitude prefactor**. AST exponent pinned to **β = 1** (canonical good-information-broadcasting regime per Zurek 2009 review) — same convention as BE-34 Kibble-Zurek's d=ν=z=1 commitment and BE-33 Hertz-Millis's 3D Heisenberg pin. Numerical evaluator remains β-agnostic.
- **Bracket-checks** (19-test encoding spec): identity at `k = 1`: `I(S:F_1) = I(S:E) - α` to 14 digits; `I(S:F_k) → I(S:E)` as `k → ∞` to 10 digits; monotonic increase in k across 6 k-values; hand-computed `I_SE = 1, α = 0.5, k = 2, β = 1 → I = 0.75`; β = 2 sanity check (evaluator β-agnostic); linearity in α; large-k decay-rate ratio `(I_SE - I(2k))/(I_SE - I(k)) = 2^(-β)` for β = 1; 4 input-validation tests.
- **BE-49 dimensional_signature updated** `null` → `'[1]'`. AST round-trips through validator to `[1]`.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` cross-check map**: added `[49, DIMENSIONLESS]`. Map size pin updated 15 → 16. `tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts` size assertion + member list updated.
- **Catalog round-trip + orphan-signature tests extended**: `ENCODED_RHS` array += BE-49; `ENCODED_RHS_IDS` set += 49.
- **16 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 23, 24, 26, 33, 34, 38, 40, 41, 43, 47, 49.



### Wave V — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-40 Composite Higgs potential (Encoded 2026-05-07)
- **BE-40 Composite Higgs (SILH) potential encoded as 15th active Tier-5 AST module** (`src/bridges/equations/be-40-composite-higgs.ts`). Exports `BE40_COMPOSITE_HIGGS_RHS: ExprNode`, `BE40_COMPOSITE_HIGGS_LHS`, `BE40_HIGGS_DIMLESS_ARG` (lemma), `evaluateCompositeHiggs({h, f, alpha, beta})`, and `validateBE40Dimensions()`.
- **Form**: `V(h) = -α f⁴ sin²(h/f) + β f⁴ [sin⁴(h/f) - sin²(h/f) cos²(h/f)]`. SI dimension: `[energy⁴] = [L^8 M^4 T^-8]` (matches BE-18). The four trig combinations (`sin²`, `cos²`, `sin⁴`, `sin²cos²`) are encoded as dimensionless symbol stubs (the AST has no transcendental primitives); h/f dimensionlessness is verified via lemma `BE40_HIGGS_DIMLESS_ARG`.
- **Bracket-checks** (22-test encoding spec): `V(h=0) = 0` (sin(0) kills both terms); `V(h = π·f, β=0) = 0` (sin(π) = 0); alpha-only minimum `V(h = π/2 · f, β=0) = -α f⁴`; SILH textbook minimum `V_min = -f⁴ (α+β)²/(8β)` at `sin²(h/f) = (α+β)/(4β)`, with α=β=1 giving V_min = -f⁴/2 to 14 digits; f⁴-homogeneity scaling check (V scales as 16 when f→2f at fixed h/f); 4 input-validation tests.
- **BE-40 dimensional_signature updated** `null` → `'[L^8 M^4 T^-8]'`. Numerical evaluator works in natural units (f, h dimensionless, TeV-scale; standard particle-physics convention).
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`**: added `[40, ENERGY_4]` (with new `ENERGY_4` = `power(ENERGY, 4)` literal in bridge-check.ts). Map size pin updated 14 → 15.
- **15 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 23, 24, 26, 33, 34, 38, 40, 41, 43, 47. **Wave V complete.**



### Wave V — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-23 SYK Planckian dissipation (Encoded 2026-05-07)
- **BE-23 SYK / Planckian-dissipation resistivity encoded as 14th active Tier-5 AST module** (`src/bridges/equations/be-23-syk-planckian.ts`). Exports `BE23_SYK_RESISTIVITY_RHS: ExprNode`, `BE23_SYK_RESISTIVITY_LHS`, `BE23_SYK_THERMAL_TERM` (lemma), `evaluateSYKResistivity({rho_0, m_star_kg, n_e_per_m3, T_K, alpha_SYK})`, and `validateBE23Dimensions()`.
- **Form**: `ρ(T) = ρ_0 + (m* · k_B T)/(n_e · e² · ℏ) · α_SYK`. SI dimension: Ω·m = kg·m³/(s³·A²) ≡ `[L^3 M T^-3 I^-2]`.
- **Lemma test**: `BE23_SYK_THERMAL_TERM` exposes the `(m* k_B T)/(n_e e² ℏ)` factor in isolation, providing direct AST-level verification of the Wave Q A1 m* prefactor fix (without m*, the SI dimension was m³/(s·C²) instead of Ω·m).
- **Bracket-checks** (18-test encoding spec): linearity in T `ρ(2T) - ρ_0 = 2·(ρ(T) - ρ_0)`; T = 0 limit `ρ(0) = ρ_0`; copper-density-carrier sanity at 100 K (finite, positive); linear scaling in `α_SYK`; hand-computed thermal-term recompute consistency; 4 input-validation tests.
- **BE-23 dimensional_signature updated** `null` → `'[L^3 M T^-3 I^-2]'` (bracketed-product form; resistivity has no NAMED_DIMENSIONS entry).
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`**: added `[23, RESISTIVITY]` (with the resistivity Dimension literal added to the bridge-check module). Map size pin updated 13 → 14.
- **14 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 23, 24, 26, 33, 34, 38, 41, 43, 47.



### Wave V — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-33 Hertz-Millis correlation length (Encoded 2026-05-07)
- **BE-33 Hertz-Millis correlation length encoded as 13th active Tier-5 AST module** (`src/bridges/equations/be-33-hertz-millis.ts`). Exports `BE33_HERTZ_MILLIS_RHS: ExprNode`, `BE33_HERTZ_MILLIS_LHS`, `evaluateHertzMillis({xi_0_m, T_K, T_0_K, nu, z})`, and `validateBE33Dimensions()`.
- **Form**: `ξ(T) = ξ_0 · (T/T_0)^(-ν/z)`. AST exponent pinned to **3D Heisenberg universality class** (z=1, ν≈0.71 → exponent -0.71); numerical evaluator remains universality-class-agnostic. Same convention as BE-34 Kibble-Zurek's d=ν=z=1 commitment. Alternative classes (3D Ising z=1 ν≈0.63; 3D XY z=1 ν≈0.67; fermionic Hertz-Millis-Moriya z=2-3) would warrant separate BE entries.
- **Bracket-checks** (20-test encoding spec): identity ξ(T_0) = ξ_0; power law `ξ(α·T_0)/ξ_0 = α^(-ν/z)` across 5 alphas to 14 digits; QCP divergence as T → 0; 3D Heisenberg `ξ(2 T_0)/ξ_0 ≈ 2^(-0.71) ≈ 0.611`; alternative-class check (3D Ising ν=0.63); 5 input-validation tests.
- **BE-33 dimensional_signature updated** `null` → `'[length]'`.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`**: added `[33, LENGTH]`. Map size pin updated 12 → 13.
- **13 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 24, 26, 33, 34, 38, 41, 43, 47.



### Wave V — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-43 ER=EPR wormhole-entropy bound (Encoded 2026-05-07)
- **BE-43 ER=EPR wormhole-entropy bound encoded as 12th active Tier-5 AST module** (`src/bridges/equations/be-43-er-epr.ts`). Exports `BE43_ER_EPR_RHS: ExprNode`, `BE43_ER_EPR_LHS`, `evaluateEREPRBound({area_m2})`, and `validateBE43Dimensions()`.
- **Form**: `S_entanglement = k_B · A_wormhole / (4 ℓ_P²)` (SI form, equivalent to BE-14's `k_B c³ A/(4 G ℏ)` since `ℓ_P² = ℏG/c³`). Mirrors BE-14 Ryu-Takayanagi's [entropy] convention exactly.
- **Bracket-checks** (15-test encoding spec): linearity `S(αA) = α·S(A)` across 5 alphas to 12 digits; `S(0) = 0`; solar-mass black hole (`A = 4π r_s²` with `r_s = 2GM_sun/c²`) gives `S ~ 10⁵⁴-10⁵⁵ J/K` (textbook Bekenstein-Hawking value); cross-check against BE-14 SI form to 6 digits; Planck-area unit `A = ℓ_P²` gives `S = k_B/4`; 3 input-validation tests.
- **BE-43 dimensional_signature updated** `null` → `'[entropy]'`. AST round-trips through validator to `[entropy]`.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` cross-check map**: added `[43, ENTROPY]`. Map size pin updated 11 → 12.
- **Catalog round-trip + orphan-signature tests extended**: `ENCODED_RHS` array += BE-43; `ENCODED_RHS_IDS` set += 43.
- **12 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 24, 26, 34, 38, 41, 43, 47.



### Wave V — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-24 Förster FRET efficiency (Encoded 2026-05-07)
- **BE-24 Förster FRET transfer efficiency encoded as 11th active Tier-5 AST module** (`src/bridges/equations/be-24-foerster-fret.ts`). Exports `BE24_FRET_EFFICIENCY_RHS: ExprNode`, `BE24_FRET_EFFICIENCY_LHS`, `evaluateFRETEfficiency({R, R_0})`, and `validateBE24Dimensions()`.
- **Form**: η = R_0⁶/(R_0⁶ + R⁶) ≡ 1/(1 + (R/R_0)⁶), the bound-respecting (η ∈ [0,1]) Förster FRET transfer efficiency. BE-24's `formula_latex` carries both this and the dipole-dipole rate `k_FRET = (1/τ_D)·(R_0/R)⁶` (dim [T^-1]); we encode the efficiency since it is the natural FRET observable and round-trips cleanly to dimensionless.
- **Bracket-checks** (22-test encoding spec): Förster radius identity η(R = R_0) = 1/2 (defining relation, to 14 digits); close-range limit η(R << R_0) → 1; long-range limit η(R >> R_0) → 0 (sextic falloff); η(R = 2 R_0) = 1/65 ≈ 0.01538 to 14 digits; η(R = R_0/2) = 64/65 ≈ 0.9846 to 14 digits; bound-respecting η ∈ [0,1] across 7 regimes; monotonic-decreasing in R; scale invariance (only R/R_0 ratio matters); 4 input-validation tests.
- **BE-24 dimensional_signature updated** `null` → `'[1]'`. AST round-trips through validator to `[1]`.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` cross-check map**: added `[24, DIMENSIONLESS]`. Map size pin updated 10 → 11. `tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts` size assertion + member list updated.
- **Catalog round-trip + orphan-signature tests extended**: `ENCODED_RHS` array += BE-24; `ENCODED_RHS_IDS` set += 24.
- **11 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 24, 26, 34, 38, 41, 47 (BE-25 archived under Wave Q B2).



### Wave U — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-38 Milgrom MOND (2026-05-06)
- **BE-38 Milgrom MOND interpolation encoded as 10th active Tier-5 AST module** (`src/bridges/equations/be-38-mond.ts`). Exports `BE38_MOND_FORCE_RHS: ExprNode`, `BE38_MOND_FORCE_LHS`, `BE38_MOND_NU_ARG`, `evaluateMONDForce({F_N_newton, m_kg, a_0_m_per_s2})`, and `validateBE38Dimensions()`.
- **Form reformulated** from implicit `F = F_N · μ⁻¹(a/a_0)` (Wave I.B C4) to explicit `F = F_N · ν(z)` with `z = F_N/(m·a_0)` and `ν(z) = √[(1+√(1+4/z²))/2]`. Mathematically equivalent (Famaey-McGaugh 2012 *Living Rev. Relativity* 15:10) but the ν-form is directly computable without an implicit-function inversion.
- **Encoding pattern**: dimensionless-stub for ν(z) opaque function, with the dimensionless argument `z = F_N/(m·a_0)` exposed as `BE38_MOND_NU_ARG` for a lemma test (verified to be DIMENSIONLESS via the validator).
- **Bracket-checks** (18-test encoding spec): Newtonian limit (`F_N >> m·a_0` → `F → F_N` to 8 digits); deep-MOND limit (`F_N << m·a_0` → `F → √(m·F_N·a_0)` to 1%); golden-ratio identity at `z = 1` (`F = F_N · √φ` where `φ = (1+√5)/2`, to 12 digits); monotonic `F/F_N` increase as `F_N` decreases; cross-derivation against implicit Milgrom relation `μ(a/a_0)·a = a_N` to 14 digits; 3 input-validation tests.
- **BE-38 dimensional_signature updated** `null` → `'[force]'`. AST round-trips through validator to `[force]`.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` cross-check map**: added `[38, FORCE]`. Map size pin updated 9 → 10. `tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts` size assertion + member list updated.
- **Catalog round-trip + orphan-signature tests extended**: `ENCODED_RHS` array += BE-38; `ENCODED_RHS_IDS` set += 38.
- **Wave I.B C4 reformulation test relaxed**: the `formula_latex` regex pin was updated to accept either the original μ-form OR the explicit ν-form (both are canonical Milgrom-class interpolations); the test now pins "canonical Milgrom interpolation" rather than a specific syntactic form.
- **Spec body in `Part-II.md` BE-38 section** updated with the explicit ν-form + bracket-check summary.
- **10 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 26, 34, 38, 41, 47 (BE-25 archived under Wave Q B2; legacy module preserved for traceability).



### Wave T — Tier-5 AST encoding for BE-12 + numerical-prefactor fix (2026-05-06)
- **BE-12 thermal de Broglie wavelength encoded as 9th Tier-5 AST module** (`src/bridges/equations/be-12-coherence-length.ts`). Exports `BE12_COHERENCE_LENGTH_RHS: ExprNode`, `BE12_COHERENCE_LENGTH_LHS`, `evaluateThermalDeBroglie({m_kg, T_K})`, and `validateBE12Dimensions()`. Both AST and numerical evaluator implement the canonical Pitaevskii-Stringari form `λ_T = √(2π ℏ²/(m k_B T))` ≡ `h/√(2π m k_B T)` (Pathria 2011 *Statistical Mechanics* 3rd ed. eq. 1.4.13). 20-test encoding spec includes catalog round-trip, dimensional structure (LHS = RHS = [length]), 6 numerical bracket-checks (H atom at 300 K → ~100 pm = 1 Å textbook; electron at 300 K → ~4 nm; cross-check identities including h-flavor ↔ ℏ-flavor agreement to 14 digits, λ ∝ 1/√m, λ ∝ 1/√T), and 4 input-validation tests.
- **NUMERICAL-PREFACTOR BUG CAUGHT BY THE AST ENCODING WORK**: the Wave Q A2 form `λ_T = ℏ/√(2π m k_B T)` was dimensionally `[length]` ✓ but numerically off by a factor of 2π from the canonical thermal de Broglie wavelength (gave ~16 pm for H at 300 K instead of the textbook ~100 pm). The canonical form has ℏ² inside the square root: `√(2π ℏ²/(m k_B T))`, equivalent to `h/√(2π m k_B T)` since `h = 2πℏ`. The BE-12 AST encoding's hydrogen-at-300K bracket-check failed against the textbook value, surfacing the bug. Wave Q A2's dimensional consistency fix was correct; the numerical prefactor was wrong. Updates: `formula_latex` in `src/bridges/index.ts`, `dimensional_signature: '[length]'` (was `null`), AST module, numerical evaluator, Part-I.md spec body. **This is exactly the value-add of Tier-5 AST encoding** — bracket-checking against textbook values catches numerical-prefactor errors that dimensional analysis alone misses.
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` cross-check map updated**: added `[12, LENGTH]`. Map size pin updated 8 → 9 (was: post-Wave-Q-B2 BE-25 archival; now: post-Wave-T BE-12 addition). `tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts` size assertion + member list updated.
- **Catalog round-trip test extended**: `tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts` `ENCODED_RHS` array now includes BE-12. `tests/bridges/orphan-dimensional-signature.test.ts` `ENCODED_RHS_IDS` set updated.
- **9 active AST encodings** total: BE-11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 26, 34, 41, 47 (BE-25 archived under Wave Q B2; the legacy Penrose-Hameroff module remains for traceability but doesn't participate in the round-trip catalog).



### Wave S — maximize spec mathematical consistency (2026-05-06)
- **BE-26 status reconciliation** (per Phys iter-7 IMPORTANT): downgraded from `'established'` to `'speculative'`. The WKB tunneling formula itself (Gamow 1928; Landau-Lifshitz QM §50) is canonical and remains so, but the *bridge framing* — that DNA mutations are dominantly explained by tunneling — is contested by ~2-4 orders of magnitude in observed mutation rates (already documented in `known_issues` since Wave I.B C6, but the prior `'established'` label was inconsistent with that gap). Updated `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-26 entry, `docs/specification/Part-II.md` BE-26 section, and `tests/bridges/be-26-encoding.test.ts` status pin (now expects `'speculative'`). Same precedent as BE-22 (Kitaev-Preskill formula canonical, UPT QG bridge framing speculative) and BE-38 (Milgrom MOND canonical, UPT bridge framing speculative).
- **BE-39 add canonical -Fg² term to β_λ** (per Math iter-7 IMP-6): the prior schematic form `β_λ = -2λ + Dλ² - Egλ + O(λ³)` was missing the canonical g²-coupling term required by the Reuter (1998) Einstein-Hilbert truncation to fix the non-Gaussian fixed point's `λ_*` value. Added `-Fg²` term (using F to avoid collision with β_g's B); new form is `β_λ = -2λ + Dλ² - Egλ - Fg² + O(λ³, g³)`. Updated `formula_latex` in `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-39 entry, the SVG-encoded equation in Part-II.md BE-39 section, and added a Wave S `known_issue` documenting the addition. Reference: Reuter 1998 *Phys. Rev. D* 57:971 (arXiv:hep-th/9605030); Reuter-Weyer 2009 *Gen. Rel. Grav.* 41:983.
- **`tractability_class` population**: 7 of the 10 prior `'undefined'` entries classified per literature: BE-18 (non-Abelian dark sector Lagrangian) → `numerical-tractable`; BE-31 (Benincasa-Dowker discrete Ricci scalar) → `numerical-tractable`; BE-38 (Milgrom MOND algebraic) → `closed-form`; BE-40 (composite Higgs polynomial potential) → `closed-form`; BE-42 (Firewall Complement quantum-state superposition) → `numerical-tractable`; BE-45 (Trans-Planckian Censorship algebraic inequality) → `closed-form`; BE-49 (Quantum Darwinism mutual-information decay) → `numerical-tractable`. Plus BE-48 (GRW Lindblad) → `numerical-tractable`. Final distribution: `closed-form` × 12, `numerical-tractable` × 21, `numerical-asymptotic` × 1, `formally-divergent` × 4, `undefined` × 2 (BE-16 + BE-37 only — both genuinely invalid). Comment on the `BridgeTractabilityClass` enum updated to reflect that 'undefined' is now reserved for invalid bridges and entries lacking a literature classification, not just "no AST encoding."
- **Status-count consistency updates**: README, Bridge-Remediation-Plan, CHANGELOG status mix updated 8/27/3/2 → 7/28/3/2 reflecting the BE-26 demotion.



### Wave R — iter-7 closing fixes (2026-05-06)
- **Math iter-7 IMP-1 fix**: Hubble-horizon area `A_H` was missing the `c²` factor required for SI dimensional consistency. The de Sitter horizon at proper radius `c/H₀` gives `A_H = 4π(c/H₀)² = 4π c²/H₀²`. Original Wave L Tier A form `A_H = 4π/H₀²` had dimensions `[T²]`, not `[L²]`. Corrected in 7+ locations across `Part-I.md` (Appendix A glossary), `Part-III.md` (Conjecture 8.1 narrative + LaTeX-encoded SVG + plausibility argument), and `Part-IV.md` (§11.1.2 scope note + holographic-bound list). The numerical claim `A_H/(4ℓ_P²) ~ 10¹²² bits` was already correct (computed using the correct `c²/H₀²` form); only the displayed formula was missing the c² factor.
- **Researcher iter-7 C1 fix**: BE-23 reference corrected — Hartnoll & Hofman 2010 *Phys. Rev. B* 81:155125 ("Generalized Lifshitz-Kosevich scaling at quantum criticality from the holographic correspondence"), NOT *Phys. Rev. D* 81:086004 (a different paper). The arXiv ID 0912.0008 was correct; only the journal/volume was wrong. Fixed in `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-23 references and CHANGELOG line.
- **Researcher iter-7 C2 fix**: BE-43 citation disambiguated — arXiv:1408.2823 is **Susskind & Zhao** "Switchbacks and the Bridge to Nowhere" (no journal); the actual *Phys. Rev. D* 90:126007 is **Stanford & Susskind** "Complexity and Shock Wave Geometries" with arXiv:**1406.2678**. Prior versions had conflated the two papers' identifiers ("Susskind, Stanford 2014 PRD 90:126007 (arXiv:1408.2823)" mixed authors of one paper with arXiv ID of another). Both papers now cited separately with correct authorship and IDs in `src/bridges/index.ts`, `Part-II.md` BE-43 section, `Bridge-Remediation-Plan.md`, and CHANGELOG.
- **CS iter-7 C1 + C2 fix**: Added inline ⚠️-prefixed tag blocks immediately preceding the SVG-encoded pseudocode for Algorithm 1 (`CONSTRUCT_UNIVERSAL_TENSOR`) and Algorithm 3A (`VALIDATE_TENSOR_CONSISTENCY`) in Part-I. Algorithm 1's tag flags `SOLVE_BRIDGE_EQUATION`, `REPAIR_INCONSISTENCY`, `ESTIMATE_THEORETICAL_CONFIDENCE`, and `CHECK_CONSTRAINT(GAUGE/UNITARITY/CORRESPONDENCE)` as ORACLE / SPEC-ONLY in the immediate visual context. Algorithm 3A's tag flags `‖Π - transformed‖_F`, `∫_Ω |ψ|² dμ`, `lim_{ℏ→0} Π_quantum` as schematic / non-load-bearing aggregate operations whose operational form is the per-cell predicates above.

### Wave Q completion — Tiers D3 + E1 (2026-05-06)
- `docs/planning/Bridge-Remediation-Plan.md` summary table updated to reflect the Wave P pivot's effect on R2 and R3 tiers. R2 count: 7 → 0 (all 12 R2 entries reformulated to canonical literature forms — Caldeira-Leggett, Jacobson, Hohenberg-Halperin, Einstein-Cartan, SYK, Förster, IIT, FLM, Hertz-Millis, TeVeS, Bekenstein-Hawking-on-ER, Wheeler-Feynman). R3 count: 7 → 2 (BE-16 + BE-37 remain genuinely unreformulable; earlier transient promotions of BE-23/25/30/43/50 to R3 were reverted in the Wave P pivot). Per Researcher iter-6 C3.
- `src/dimensional/README.md` adds a "Limitation: `^` operator requires literal-numeric exponents" section documenting the silent-fallthrough footgun for symbolic exponents. Workarounds named: literal value when concrete (e.g., BE-34 Kibble-Zurek `(τ_Q/τ_0)^(-0.5)`), dimensionless-stub for scheme-dependent forms (e.g., BE-21 `r^{2Δ-d}`), and a future AST extension `kind: 'op-pow-symbolic'` filed as Tier-5 followup. Per CS iter-6 C4.
- D2 (IIT 4.0 year disambiguation, per Researcher iter-6 C2) and E2 (Status invariant 4 vacuity hedge, per Phys iter-6 C3) were already addressed at Wave P-D / Wave P-A Tier 0-4 respectively; no additional action required.

### Wave Q — iter-6 comprehensive repair (2026-05-06)

Wave Q addresses the 12 CRITICAL findings identified in the iter-6 paper-
review pass under `~/.claude/playground/upt-paper-review-2026-05-06-iter-6/`.
All findings localized — no systemic regressions to the Wave P pivot.

#### Tier A — Wave P dimensional regressions (HIGHEST priority)

- **A1 (Math iter-6 C1)**: BE-23 add `m*` carrier effective mass.
  The Wave P-C R-C1 form `ρ(T) = ρ_0 + (k_B T/ℏ)·(1/(n_e e²))·α_SYK`
  was missing the `m*` prefactor required by the canonical
  Drude+Planckian decomposition; SI dimensional analysis without
  `m*` yields `m³/(s·C²)` rather than the required `Ω·m`. Canonical
  form is now `ρ(T) = ρ_0 + (m* k_B T)/(n_e e² ℏ)·α_SYK`.
- **A2 (Math iter-6 C2)**: BE-12 drop γ — canonical thermal de Broglie.
  The Wave P-B R-B1 form `ξ = ℏ/√(2 m k_B T γ)` doesn't yield length
  under either γ convention (γ as Ohmic friction with `[γ] = 1/s`
  gives `√s` not `m`; γ as a dimensionless coefficient leaves an
  arbitrary numerical scaling). Reverted to the strictly-canonical
  thermal de Broglie wavelength `λ_T = ℏ / √(2π m k_B T)`, which is
  dimensionally clean.

#### Tier B — BE-25 cleanup residuals

- **B1 (CS iter-6 C1)**: BE-25 `tractability_class` corrected from
  `'formally-divergent'` to `'numerical-asymptotic'`. The prior label
  miscategorized Φ_max as non-Turing-computable; in fact Φ_max IS
  computable — the issue is exponential complexity (EXPTIME), so it is
  asymptotically intractable for systems beyond ~10 elements but
  remains finite, calculable, and well-defined for any finite substrate.
- **B2 (CS iter-6 C2)**: BE-25 stale AST archived. The legacy
  `src/bridges/equations/be-25-orch-or.ts` module encodes the dropped
  Penrose-Hameroff `t_OR` form; under the Wave P-D R-D2 IIT Φ_max
  reformulation, BE-25's `dimensional_signature` is `null` so the AST
  is no longer load-bearing. Module preserved with archive banner for
  historical traceability; removed from `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE`
  cross-check map (size 9 → 8) and from the round-trip
  `dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`. The legacy
  `tests/bridges/be-25-encoding.test.ts` archive regression is retained.

#### Tier C — Excise displayed-but-invalid formulas

- **C1 (Phys iter-6 C1)**: BE-16 displayed formula excised from
  `docs/specification/Part-I.md`. The ansatz `dS/dt = k_B C(ρ) ∂I/∂t`
  was still being shown in the spec body even though BE-16's
  invalid disposition is correct (the formula is algebraically
  self-refuting under `I = Tr(ρ log ρ) = -S_vN`). Replaced with a
  disposition note pointing at `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-16 and at
  the Status paragraph's algebraic argument. Formula preserved in
  commit history.
- **C2 (Phys iter-6 C2)**: BE-37 VSL ansatz excised from
  `docs/specification/Part-II.md`. Same pattern as C1 — the
  Ellis-Uzan operational-meaninglessness disposition is correct,
  but the displayed `c(t) = c_0[1 + ε(t/t_P)^n exp(-t/t_c)]` ansatz
  and modified Friedmann equation were still being rendered.
  Replaced with a disposition note pointing at `src/bridges/index.ts`
  BE-37 and `docs/planning/BE-37-VSL-Disposition-Brief.md`.
- **C3 (CS iter-6 C3)**: Part-IV §11.2.1 retracted cardinality
  formula `|𝒞(Π)| < |𝒰(Π)|` excised from the displayed body.
  The formula was retracted in Wave I.B D5 (the cardinality framing
  didn't capture the runtime-vs-shortcut argument) but was retained
  "for traceability" — reader's eye lands on the formula, not the
  hedge. Replaced with a one-paragraph note pointing at the
  Wolfram-irreducibility framing as the canonical statement.

#### Tier D — Wave P-D summary commit drift

- **D1 (Researcher iter-6 C1)**: Wave-P-A summary table fix in
  CHANGELOG. The pivot summary table contradicted the per-bridge
  entries: BE-43 was listed as "FLM" but the canonical Wave P-A
  R-A3 form is Bekenstein-Hawking applied to the ER bridge
  cross-section (`S_entanglement ~ A_wormhole / (4 ℓ_P²)`); BE-50
  was listed as "Israel-Darmois junction" but the canonical Wave P-A
  R-A4 form is Wheeler-Feynman half-retarded-plus-half-advanced
  (`A_μ = ½(A^ret + A^adv)`). Table row corrected.

### Wave P Reformulation Pivot — Final State (2026-05-06)

The Wave P sequence (P-A, P-B, P-C, P-D) implements a strategic pivot in
how UPT handles R3-invalid bridges: rather than preserving them as
historical record (the Wave J/L approach), Wave P **completes** each
bridge to a canonical literature form when one exists. This trades
verbatim-spec preservation for catalog usefulness (every bridge that
admits a canonical form now points at one, with the bridge framing —
not the equation — as the speculative element).

**12 bridges reformulated under the Wave P pivot:**

| Wave | BEs reformulated | Canonical form |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| P-A (4) | BE-30, 33, 43, 50 | FLM `δS_EE = ⟨δH_R⟩` (BE-30); Hertz-Millis 3D Heisenberg `ξ ~ T^{-ν/z}` (BE-33); Bekenstein-Hawking applied to ER bridge cross-section `S_entanglement ~ A_wormhole / (4 ℓ_P²)` (BE-43); Wheeler-Feynman half-retarded-plus-half-advanced `A_μ = ½(A^ret + A^adv)` (BE-50) |
| P-B (3) | BE-12, 13, 17 | Caldeira-Leggett dephasing length; Jacobson 1995 thermodynamic Einstein eqs; canonical Einstein-Cartan torsion-spin |
| P-C (3) | BE-23, 24, 36 | SYK / Planckian-dissipation linear-in-T; Förster FRET; Bekenstein 2004 TeVeS |
| P-D (2) | BE-15, 25 | Hohenberg-Halperin Model A gradient flow; IIT Φ_max integrated information |

Plus 2 earlier-loop reformulations outside the Wave P sequence (BE-22
Kitaev-Preskill / Levin-Wen TEE, Wave 2; BE-38 Milgrom MOND, Wave I.B
C4) for **14 total reformulations across the project**.

**Final catalog status distribution (40 bridges):**
- `established` × 8
- `speculative` × 27
- `highly-speculative` × 3
- `invalid` × 2

**Final invalid count: 2 (BE-16 + BE-37 only)** — both genuinely
unreformulable:

- **BE-16 (Complexity-Entropy Production Relation)** is algebraically
  self-refuting: combining `I = Tr(ρ log ρ) = -S_vN` with the master
  relation forces `dS/dt = 0` for any `C(ρ) > -1/k_B`, violating the
  Second Law. No reformulation is possible without abandoning the
  framework's anchoring identification of `I` with `-S_vN`.
- **BE-37 (Variable Speed of Light Cosmology)** fails Ellis-Uzan
  operational-meaninglessness (Ellis-Uzan 2005, arXiv:gr-qc/0305099):
  varying `c` is not a falsifiable physical proposal under canonical
  covariance arguments; furthermore the Albrecht-Magueijo / Moffat /
  Barrow VSL frameworks are non-equivalent, with no canonical form to
  commit to. Disposition pinned 2026-05-05 per
  `docs/planning/BE-37-VSL-Disposition-Brief.md`.

**Test count progression across the Wave P sequence:**

- Pre Wave P-A: 437 tests
- Post Wave P-A (R-A1..A4): 446 tests (+9)
- Post Wave P-B (R-B1..B3): 450 tests (+4)
- Post Wave P-C (R-C1..C3): 463 tests (+13)
- Post Wave P-D (R-D1..D2): 477 tests (+14)

**Reformulation pin tests** at
`tests/bridges/be-{12,13,15,17,22,23,24,25,30,33,36,38,43,50}-reformulation.test.ts`
(14 files); R3-invalid pin tests at
`tests/bridges/be-{16,37}-r3-disposition.test.ts` (2 files).

### Added
- **Wave P-D R-D2 — BE-25 reformulated to canonical Integrated Information
  Theory (IIT, Tononi) Φ_max form.**
  - Replaced the Tegmark-falsified Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR form
    `t_OR = ℏ/(Δm c² Δx/ℓ_P)` — which combined a non-Penrose `Δx/ℓ_P`
    factor (Penrose's canonical gravitational self-energy is
    `E_G ~ G(Δm)²/Δx`) with a microtubule-coherence mechanism that
    Tegmark 2000 *Phys. Rev. E* 61:4194 falsified by ~10 orders of
    magnitude (decoherence ~10⁻¹³ s vs. neural processing ~10⁻³ s
    at biological temperature) — with the canonical Integrated
    Information Theory minimum-information-partition form:

    `Φ_max(S) = min_θ [ ii(s, s̃) - ii_θ(s, s̃) ]`

    with intrinsic information

    `ii(s, s̃) = p(s̃ | s) log₂ [ p(s̃ | s) / p(s̃) ]`

    where θ ranges over bipartitions of S (the MIP is the partition
    that minimally reduces intrinsic information).
  - Status: `invalid` → `speculative`. IIT itself is canonical and
    calculable (Tononi 2008 *Biol. Bull.* 215:216 — original IIT;
    Oizumi-Albantakis-Tononi 2014 *PLoS Comput. Biol.* 10:e1003588 —
    IIT 3.0 with calculable Φ via earth-mover's distance over
    partitions; Albantakis et al. 2023 *PLoS Comput. Biol.*
    19:e1011465 / arXiv:2212.14787 — IIT 4.0 with explicit axiom-
    postulate framework). The bridge framing — treating Φ_max as the
    canonical UPT consciousness ↔ information bridge — is the
    speculative element: (a) Tononi's identification of phenomenal
    consciousness with maximally-integrated information is contested
    by Aaronson 2014 (computational counterexamples) and Doerig
    et al. 2019 *Conscious Cogn.* 72:49 (unfolding argument); (b) the
    original UPT framing of consciousness ↔ *quantum* information is
    dropped — IIT is substrate-agnostic and makes no claim about
    quantum coherence, so the Tegmark and McKemmish Orch-OR
    falsifications are moot under the reformulation.
  - **Important — downstream excisions retained:** Part-IV §12.3,
    Part-V §21.2.2, and Part-VI §28.2 were excised in Wave L Tier B3
    because BE-25 was Penrose-Hameroff. Those excisions are **not
    restored** under this IIT reformulation: the original sections
    were tied to the Penrose-Hameroff cosmic-consciousness /
    clinical-applications framings, and IIT-based clinical applications
    (e.g., perturbational complexity index PCI in disorders of
    consciousness — Casali et al. 2013 *Sci. Transl. Med.* 5:198ra105)
    are an active research area outside UPT's current scope.
  - `tractability_class`: `closed-form` → `formally-divergent`.
    Φ_max computation is exponential in the number of elements
    (intractable beyond ~10 elements); approximate measures (Φ*, Φ^G,
    geometric Φ) exist for larger systems but each gives different
    numbers and is not interchangeable with Φ_max.
  - `dimensional_signature`: `[time]` → `null`. Φ has units of bits
    (information) when log₂ is used; the IIT 3.0/4.0 framework pins
    units separately rather than via SI dimensional analysis.
  - **Stale Tier-5 AST encoding noted:** the legacy module
    `src/bridges/equations/be-25-orch-or.ts` encodes the dropped
    Penrose-Hameroff `t_OR` form. It is preserved for traceability
    and for AST-validator regression coverage but no longer
    participates in the bridge-index dimensional_signature catalog
    (`tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts` — BE-25
    removed). A future Tier-5 sweep can retire the module or re-encode
    the IIT Φ_max form (note: Φ is exponential in system size, so
    AST encoding may not be tractable beyond ~10 elements).
  - Test file replacement: `tests/bridges/be-25-r3-disposition.test.ts`
    deleted; `tests/bridges/be-25-reformulation.test.ts` added (15
    tests; honest-archaeology pattern). The legacy
    `tests/bridges/be-25-encoding.test.ts` is rewritten as a stale-AST
    archive (asserts `status === 'speculative'`,
    `dimensional_signature === null`, and exercises the legacy
    AST validator regression on the dropped form).
  - Honest-claude flag: WebFetch on arXiv:2212.14787 (IIT 4.0 preprint)
    returned only abstract content (axiom-postulate framework);
    WebFetch on Wikipedia "Integrated information theory" /
    "Phi (integrated information theory)" provided the canonical
    Φ-via-MIP formula and the intrinsic-information form
    `ii(s,s̃) = p(s̃|s) log₂[p(s̃|s)/p(s̃)]`. The earth-mover's-distance
    / Wasserstein-metric specific computation in IIT 3.0 follows the
    canonical Oizumi-Albantakis-Tononi 2014 *PLoS Comput. Biol.* paper
    rather than a fresh WebFetch.

- **Wave P-D R-D1 — BE-15 reformulated to canonical Hohenberg-Halperin
  Model A purely-dissipative gradient flow.**
  - Replaced the conflated form
    `∂O_macro/∂t = F[{O_micro}] + η∇²O_macro + ζ(∂²S/∂O²)` (LHS an
    observable rate; RHS `F[{O_micro}]` an RG-flow functional that
    evolves a coupling along scale `k`, not an observable along time
    `t` — disjoint physical objects evolving along different parameter
    axes) with the canonical Hohenberg-Halperin Model A purely-dissipative
    gradient flow:

    `∂φ/∂t = -Γ δH/δφ + ζ(x,t)`

    with FDT noise correlator
    `⟨ζ(x,t) ζ(x',t')⟩ = 2 Γ k_B T δ(x-x') δ(t-t')`
    and Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian
    `H[φ] = ∫d³x [½(∇φ)² + V(φ)]` with polynomial V(φ).
  - Status: `invalid` → `speculative`. The Hohenberg-Halperin Model A
    Langevin equation is canonical condensed-matter physics
    (Hohenberg-Halperin 1977 *Rev. Mod. Phys.* 49:435 — the Model
    A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/J taxonomy); the bridge framing — treating Model A
    as the UPT microscale ↔ emergent bridge by committing to a slow-
    mode coarse-graining — is the speculative element.
  - Selecting Model A pins the order parameter as **non-conserved**.
    Conserved-density (Model B), order-parameter-coupled-to-conserved-
    density (Model C), and fluid (Model H) variants each require a
    distinct BE entry; Wetterich exact RG flow and Mori-Zwanzig
    projector-operator alternatives represent different reformulation
    paths covering different physical scenarios. The original
    "universal" framing is dropped — there is no single emergence
    equation that covers all coarse-grainings.
  - `tractability_class`: `undefined` → `numerical-tractable` (Model A
    is a stochastic PDE with established forward-Euler / stochastic-
    Heun numerical methods).
  - Test file replacement: `tests/bridges/be-15-r3-disposition.test.ts`
    deleted; `tests/bridges/be-15-reformulation.test.ts` added (12
    tests; honest-archaeology pattern).
  - Honest-claude flag: WebFetch on the Hohenberg-Halperin RMP itself
    returned 403 (paywall); WebFetch on Wikipedia "Critical phenomena"
    confirmed only the Hohenberg-Halperin nomenclature with one
    numerical Model-H example (`x_η ≃ 0.068, z ≃ 3.068`); the explicit
    Model A Langevin form and FDT noise correlator follow standard
    textbook references (Chaikin-Lubensky 1995 *Principles of Condensed
    Matter Physics* Ch. 8; Goldenfeld 1992 *Lectures on Phase
    Transitions and the Renormalization Group*; Stanley 1971).

- **Wave P-C R-C3 — BE-36 reformulated to canonical Bekenstein 2004 TeVeS
  relativistic MOND.**
  - Replaced the bespoke hybrid linear blend
    `F = F_N μ(a/a_0) + F_DM (1 − μ(a/a_0))` (not in any published MOND
    literature, original to this framework) with the canonical Bekenstein
    2004 TeVeS (Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity) relativistic completion of
    MOND: action `S = S_g + S_φ + S_A + S_matter` with three dynamical
    fields:
    - `g_μν` — metric (Einstein-Hilbert action)
    - `φ` — scalar field with MOND interpolation function `μ̃(y)`
    - `A^μ` — timelike 4-vector with Lagrange multiplier enforcing
      `A^μ A_μ = -1`
    - `S_matter` couples through the physical metric
      `ĝ_μν = e^{-2φ} g_μν − 2 sinh(2φ) A_μ A_ν`
  - The non-relativistic weak-field limit recovers the canonical MOND
    interpolation `F_eff = F_N · μ̃^{-1}(F_N/(F_N + a_0))`, reducing to
    the Milgrom `μ(x) = x/√(1+x²)` form covered by BE-38.
  - Status: `invalid` → `speculative`. TeVeS is canonical relativistic
    MOND (Bekenstein 2004 *Phys. Rev. D* 70:083509, arXiv:astro-ph/
    0403694; Famaey-McGaugh 2012 *Living Rev. Relativ.* 15:10,
    arXiv:1112.3960; Skordis 2009 *CQG* 26:143001 review); the bridge
    framing — TeVeS as the UPT gravity ↔ dark-sector bridge —
    remains the speculative element.
  - **Known issue documented:** GW170817 graviton-speed bound
    `|c_g − c|/c ≲ 10⁻¹⁵` (Abbott et al. 2017 *ApJ Lett.* 848:L13;
    Boran et al. 2018 *Phys. Rev. D* 97:041501, arXiv:1710.06168)
    strongly constrains original TeVeS variants — only carefully-
    tuned subclasses or successor RMT theories (Skordis-Złośnik 2021
    *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 127:161302, arXiv:2007.00082) survive. Marked
    as severity `other` / fixable `reformulation` for future-work
    refinement.
  - **Relationship to BE-38 clarified:** BE-38 covers the
    non-relativistic Milgrom `μ(x) = x/√(1+x²)` form (Wave I.B C4
    reformulation); BE-36 covers the relativistic completion. Different
    physical content, complementary not duplicative. dependencies:
    `[38]` records this relationship.
  - `tractability_class`: `undefined` → `numerical-tractable` (TeVeS
    PDEs solved numerically for cosmology + galaxy dynamics).
  - Test file replacement: `tests/bridges/be-36-r3-disposition.test.ts`
    deleted; `tests/bridges/be-36-reformulation.test.ts` added (14
    tests; honest-archaeology pattern).
  - Honest-claude flag: WebFetch on arXiv:astro-ph/0403694 returned
    only abstract content (TeVeS as relativistic MOND completion with
    three dynamical fields, Newtonian + MOND limits); the explicit
    action terms `S_g, S_φ, S_A, S_matter` and the physical-metric
    coupling `ĝ_μν` follow standard TeVeS-review references. The
    GW170817 constraint is sourced from review-level information.

- **Wave P-C R-C2 — BE-24 reformulated to canonical Förster (1948) FRET.**
  - Replaced the bound-violating multiplicative form
    `η_classical(1 + κ exp(-t/τ_coh) |⟨ψ_d|ψ_a⟩|²)` (admits η > 1 for
    `κ ∈ [0.1, 0.3]` and `η_classical ≈ 1`) with the canonical Förster
    (1948) FRET formulas:
    - dipole-dipole transfer rate: `k_FRET = (1/τ_D)(R_0/R)⁶`
    - bound-respecting transfer efficiency:
      `η = R_0⁶/(R_0⁶ + R⁶) = 1/(1 + (R/R_0)⁶) ∈ [0,1]` by construction
  - The "quantum enhancement factor" κ is dropped — no canonical
    photosynthesis-FRET literature uses a multiplicative coherent-
    enhancement correction. FRET itself is incoherent: it does not
    encode "quantum-coherent enhancement," and Cao 2020 *Sci. Adv.*
    6:eaaz4888 et al. show that observed long-lived FMO oscillations
    are vibrational rather than electronic.
  - Status: `invalid` → `speculative`. FRET is canonical (Förster
    1948 *Ann. Phys.* 437:55; Lakowicz 2006 textbook); the bridge
    framing — quantum coherence in photosynthesis as a UPT bridge —
    remains the speculative element.
  - `tractability_class`: `undefined` → `closed-form` (single
    algebraic formula given R, R_0, τ_D).
  - HEOM (Ishizaki-Fleming 2009 *J. Chem. Phys.* 130:234111) and
    Lindblad GKSL (Mohseni-Rebentrost-Lloyd-Aspuru-Guzik 2008 *J. Chem.
    Phys.* 129:174106; ENAQT framework) retained as alternative-path
    references for any future coherent-transport reformulation.
  - Test file replacement: `tests/bridges/be-24-r3-disposition.test.ts`
    deleted; `tests/bridges/be-24-reformulation.test.ts` added (10
    tests; honest-archaeology pattern).
  - Honest-claude flag: WebFetch on the Wikipedia "Förster resonance
    energy transfer" article confirmed `k_ET = (R_0/r)⁶/τ_D`,
    `R_0⁶ ∝ κ² Q_D J / n⁴`, and `E = 1/(1 + (r/R_0)⁶)`. The Cao 2020
    contested-coherence consensus is documented from the prior
    R3-disposition record without a separate WebFetch.

- **Wave P-C R-C1 — BE-23 reformulated to canonical SYK / Planckian-dissipation
  linear-in-T resistivity.**
  - Replaced the algebraically-vacuous form `ρ(T) = ρ_0 + AT +
    B √(ℏ/(k_B T τ_P))` (the third term collapses to `B · 1` under the
    definitional identity `τ_P · k_B T = ℏ`) with the canonical
    Planckian-dissipation linear-in-T form
    `ρ(T) = ρ_0 + (k_B T / ℏ) · (1/(n_e e²)) · α_SYK`, where the SYK
    relaxation rate `τ ~ ℏ/(k_B T)` sets the slope and `α_SYK` is a
    dimensionless O(1) coefficient depending on the SYK-q variant (q=4
    most studied; the conformal two-point function is
    `G(τ) ∝ |τ|^{-2/q}`). The "duality" framing connects to
    Maldacena-Stanford 2016 emergent SL(2,R) conformal symmetry in SYK
    and to Hartnoll-Hofman 2010 holographic momentum-relaxed strange
    metals (arXiv:0912.0008).
  - Status: `invalid` → `speculative`. Linear-in-T Planckian
    phenomenology is empirically established (Bruin 2013 *Science*
    339:804; Legros 2019 *Nature Phys.* 15:142) and the SYK
    microscopic origin is canonical (Sachdev-Ye 1993; Kitaev 2015
    KITP; Maldacena-Stanford 2016 *Phys. Rev. D* 94:106002,
    arXiv:1604.07818); the *bridge framing* — treating SYK Planckian
    dissipation as a UPT condensed-matter ↔ holography duality —
    remains the speculative element.
  - `tractability_class`: `undefined` → `numerical-tractable` (SYK
    Schwinger-Dyson equations are solvable on a grid; α_SYK is a
    single dimensionless coefficient given the chosen q).
  - Reference set extended: Sachdev-Ye 1993 PRL 70:3339; Kitaev 2015

    tests; honest-archaeology pattern from Wave-P-B).
  - Honest-claude flag: WebFetch on arXiv:1604.07818 returned only
    abstract content (emergent SL(2,R) conformal symmetry, two- and
    four-point function study); the explicit Green's function form
    `G(τ) ∝ |τ|^{-2/q}` and the resistivity-prefactor commitment
    follow standard SYK textbook references. The α_SYK bundling
    preserves the bridge framing without committing to a specific
    q-value.

- **Wave P-B R-B3 — BE-17 reformulated to canonical Einstein-Cartan torsion-spin coupling.**
  - Replaced the conflated form `R_μν^λρ = R̊_μν^λρ + K_μν^λρ +
    α(F_μν F^λρ − (1/4) g_μν F_αβ F^αβ)` (three orthogonal structural
    defects: rank-4-vs-rank-2 Maxwell-stress-energy mismatch;
    `ℓ_EM = √(ℏc/e²)` dimensionless in Gaussian / not a length in SI;
    non-canonical rank-4 contorsion `K_μν^λρ` vs the canonical rank-3
    EC contorsion `K^ρ_μν`) with the canonical Einstein-Cartan field
    equations: standard Einstein equation `R_μν − (1/2) R g_μν +
    Λ g_μν = (8πG/c⁴) T_μν` together with the algebraic torsion-spin
    coupling `T^λ_μν = (8πG/c⁴) S^λ_μν`, where `T^λ_μν` is the
    canonical rank-3 torsion tensor (antisymmetric in lower indices)
    and `S^λ_μν` is the spin angular momentum density tensor.
  - **The "Electromagnetic-Gravitational Unification via Torsion"
    claim is dropped** — EC torsion is sourced by spin angular
    momentum density, NOT by EM fields. The original BE-17 conflated
    EC theory (with spin-source torsion) with an unrelated unification
    scheme (with EM-source torsion); the EM-source claim is a
    category error. Recovering an EM-gravity bridge would require a
    separate framework (Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction; non-
    minimal F²·R curvature coupling), each warranting its own BE entry.
  - WebFetch on Trautman 2006 (arXiv:gr-qc/0606062) confirmed the

    torsion, in addition to curvature, and relating torsion to the
    density of intrinsic angular momentum."

- **Wave P-B R-B2 — BE-13 reformulated to canonical Jacobson 1995 thermodynamic derivation of Einstein equations.**
  - Replaced the Landauer-mis-attributed form `R_μν − (1/2) R g_μν =
    (8πG/c⁴)[T_μν^matter + k_B T ln(2) I_μν]` (Landauer's principle is
    a 0+1-dim erasure-cost bound, not a stress-energy tensor; the I_μν
    term was dimensionally non-closing and double-counted information
    into a separate tensor) with the canonical Jacobson 1995
    thermodynamic-derivation form: standard Einstein field equations
    `R_μν − (1/2) R g_μν + Λ g_μν = (8πG/c⁴) T_μν`, with the
    *interpretation* that they arise as a macroscopic equation of state
    from the Clausius relation `δQ = T dS` applied to all local Rindler
    causal horizons through each spacetime point.
  - WebFetch on arXiv:gr-qc/9504004 confirmed the abstract: "The
    Einstein equation is derived from the proportionality of entropy
    and horizon area together with the fundamental relation δQ = T dS.
    The relation is required to hold for all the local Rindler causal
    horizons through each spacetime point, with δQ and T interpreted
    as the energy flux and Unruh temperature seen by an accelerated
    observer."
  - The spurious `k_B T ln(2) I_μν` term is dropped (Jacobson has no
    such term). Alternative non-equivalent thermodynamic-origin paths
    (Verlinde 2011 entropic gravity arXiv:1001.0785; Padmanabhan 2010
    emergent gravity arXiv:0911.5004) cited as comparison references;

- **Wave P-B R-B1 — BE-12 reformulated to canonical Caldeira-Leggett dephasing length.**
  - Replaced the structurally ill-defined `ξ_coh(T,N) = ξ_0 / √(1 +
    N/N_c + (T/T_c)^ν)` ansatz (three undefined quantities: ξ_0,
    ω_decoherence, cube exponent in N_c) with the canonical Caldeira-
    Leggett dephasing length / thermal de Broglie wavelength form:
    `ξ_dephasing(T) = ℏ / √(2 m k_B T γ)` where m is particle mass,
    γ is the Caldeira-Leggett Ohmic friction (dissipation) coefficient,
    and the form is dimensionally consistent with the thermal de
    Broglie wavelength `λ_T = h / √(2π m k_B T)`.
  - WebFetch on Wikipedia "Thermal de Broglie wavelength" confirmed the
    canonical λ_T form. Caldeira-Leggett 1981 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 46:211

- **Wave P-A R-A4 — BE-50 reformulated to canonical Wheeler-Feynman half-retarded-plus-half-advanced form.**
  - Replaced the broken `S = ∫d⁴x [L_forward(φ_+) + L_backward(φ_-) +
    λφ_+ φ_- δ⁴(x − x_m)]` action (variationally ill-posed at the δ⁴
    single-point interaction) with the canonical Wheeler-Feynman 1945
    absorber-theory gauge-field form:
    `A_μ(x) = (1/2)[A_μ^ret(x) + A_μ^adv(x)]`
    The action is then standard Maxwell + matter + interaction with
    this gauge-field expression.
  - WebFetch on Wikipedia Wheeler-Feynman_absorber_theory confirmed the
    canonical form: "the resulting field is E_tot(x,t) = Σ_n [E_n^ret +
    E_n^adv]/2" (gauge-field analogue is the A_μ form above). The
    "absorber" boundary condition (every emitted radiation absorbed
    somewhere) makes this physically equivalent to standard retarded-
    only Maxwell, per Wheeler & Feynman's original argument.

### Changed
- **Wave P-A Tier 0-4 — Part-I §1.3 invariant 4 empty-pairs hedge (Phys iter-5 C3).**
  - Added a hedge note to §1.3 invariant 4 (Correspondence Principle):
    the `lim_{ℏ→0}` predicate cannot be exercised because BEs 1-10 (the
    implicit diagonal laws — Schrödinger, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, SM)
    are not currently encoded as explicit quantum/classical pairs in
    `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS`, and BEs 11-50 do not present pair structure.
    The iteration is over the empty set; the invariant is vacuously
    satisfied. Hedge clarifies invariant 4 as a forward-looking
    specification, becoming operational only once Tier-5 work adds
    explicit pair rows (e.g., a `classical_partner_id?: number` field).

### Fixed
- **Wave P-A Tier 0-3 — BE-25 quantitative-failure check restructured as alternatives (Phys iter-5 C2).**
  - Part-II §G "Quantitative failure check" for BE-25 (Penrose-Hameroff
    Orch-OR) was previously stating both Tegmark (decoherence) and
    Penrose-form (formula-malformedness) falsifications as
    simultaneously-applicable. They are alternatives under different
    coherence assumptions: (a) under Penrose's canonical E_G ~
    G(Δm)²/Δx, Tegmark's decoherence ~10⁻¹³ s rules out the mechanism;
    (b) under the framework's E_G = Δm c² Δx / ℓ_P, the formula itself
    yields sub-Planckian t_OR (~10⁻⁵⁵ s), foreclosing the coherence
    assumption Tegmark presupposes. Restructured to "either (a) or (b),
    not both — the bridge fails under either canonical interpretation."
    BE-25 notes in src/bridges/index.ts updated to reference the
    restructure. R3-invalid disposition unchanged. All 437 tests pass.
- **Wave P-A Tier 0-2 — BE-19 AST docstring 32π² prefactor sync (Math iter-5 CRIT-2).**
  - `src/bridges/equations/be-19-quantum-bounce.ts` docstring prefactor
    updated from `√3/(16π²γ³)` to `√3/(32π²γ³)` to match Part-I §6 and
    `formula_latex` in `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-19. Wave N Tier B
    reconciled the spec to 32π² (yielding canonical 0.41 ρ_Planck) but
    missed this AST docstring; it still claimed "16π² → 0.41 ρ_Planck"
    which is internally inconsistent (16π² yields ~0.82 ρ_Planck).
    All 437 tests still pass; no behavioral change.

### Changed
- **Wave P-A Tier 0-1 — Part-V Conclusion R3-list pointer-only (Math iter-5 CRIT-1).**
  - Replaced stale hard-coded list of 7 R3-invalid bridges (cited as of Wave J/L)
    in Part-V Conclusion line 1205 with a pointer to `src/bridges/index.ts` as
    the single source of truth. Wave N Tier C escalations (BE-12, 13, 15, 17,
    24, 33, 36) had propagated to Part-VI but missed Part-V; the actual
    catalog had 14 R3-invalid bridges at the time of the iter-5 review,
    not 7. Pointer-only approach eliminates the drift class entirely
    (matches Wave N-completion D5 pattern).
- **Wave N-completion Tier E — minor polish from iter-4 (LaTeX, glossary, citations).**
  - **E2 [Phys MINOR]:** BE-27 FDT prefactor verification note added —
    classical FDT canonical forms (Kubo 1966, Callen-Welton 1951) cited;
    the displayed `1/(k_B T_eff)` prefactor outside an integral over
    cross-correlator `⟨δF δx⟩` is non-standard (canonical forms use
    auto-correlators); flagged as schematic.
  - **E3 [Phys MINOR]:** BE-39 asymptotic-safety A sign convention note
    added — `+A g²` follows the convention where `A > 0` is required for
    the non-Gaussian UV fixed point; sign conventions vary across the
    literature (Reuter-Weyer 2009, Codello-Percacci-Rahmede 2009 differ in
    factors-of-2π absorption).
  - **E4 [Phys MINOR]:** Part-IV §11.1.1 undefined `f` and `𝓞` symbols
    — added a Symbol-definition note clarifying that `f[Π(x)] → g_{μν}(x)`
    is schematic and that `𝓞` in `Tr[Π†𝓞Π]` is a not-here-specified
    symmetry generator (per the catalog-framing scope note).
  - **E5 [Researcher MINOR]:** Glossary `n` row added BE-20 entry (integer
    mode index in vacuum-fluctuation mode-sum, paired with `ζ(k/k_UV)`).
  - **E6 [Researcher MINOR]:** Verified BE-39 Reuter 1998 already cites
    arXiv:hep-th/9605030 in `references[]`; spec-body Status note now
    includes the arXiv ID inline for parity.
  - **E7 [Researcher MINOR]:** Framework-stats string ("~498K chars") was
    triplicated across Part-V conclusion, Part-VI §28 paragraph, and
    Part-VI §29 stats block. Designated Part-VI §29 as single source of
    truth; Part-V conclusion + Part-VI §28 paragraph now point to it.
  - **E8 [Phys/Researcher consistency]:** Part-IV §11.1.2 displayed
    holographic bound `I ≤ A/(4ℓ_P²)` updated to `I ≤ A_H/(4ℓ_P²)` to
    match the §11.1.2 scope note (which says it should be Hubble-horizon
    area `A_H` per Conjecture 8.1, Part-III §VIII).
  - **E1:** No specific LaTeX cosmetic instance was flagged with a precise
    location in iter-4; deferred until a concrete example surfaces.
- **Wave N-completion Tier D — 8 mechanical IMPORTANT fixes (iter-4 batch).**
  - **D1 [Phys IMPORTANT]:** Part-V §19.3.1 split bare `[S]` (Entropy/Action
    overload) into `[S_E]` (J/K) and `[S_A]` (J·s) — different SI dimensions
    were conflated, making the dimensional-consistency checker (§19.3.2)
    ill-defined.
  - **D2 [Math IMP-2]:** Part-I glossary η row corrected — η_{μν} appears
    in BE-30 (ER=EPR generalized), not BE-21 as previously stated.
  - **D3 [Math IMP-3]:** Part-I §1.3 invariant 1 explicitly clarified as a
    *typo-detector* on the AST round-trip — does NOT validate physical
    correctness; downstream physics-level checks (`references[]`,
    `known_issues[]`, `bridges/*-fix.test.ts`) are what catch sign / canonical
    / attribution errors.
  - **D4 [Researcher IMPORTANT]:** Part-III preamble Algorithm 3 / 3A / 3B
    reconciliation note refreshed — reconciliation completed in Wave J Tier
    E4 / Wave L; struck stale "pending reconciliation" framing.
  - **D5 [Researcher IMPORTANT]:** Part-VI §29 hard-coded 27-entry BE-list
    (line 722) and "27 BEs" framework-stat (line 737) replaced with single
    pointer to `src/bridges/index.ts`. Wave L Tier H3 had eliminated the
    same duplication from Part-V; this closes the regression vector.
  - **D6 [Researcher IMPORTANT]:** Part-I glossary T-stress-energy row now
    includes BE-13 (was BE-29, BE-30, BE-43; now BE-13, BE-29, BE-30, BE-43).
  - **D7 [Researcher IMPORTANT]:** Part-VI §29 algorithm-count claim "11
    formally numbered (Algorithms 1-11)" corrected to **12 numbered sections**
    (1, 2, 3A, 3B, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) — the 3A/3B split makes it 12
    not 11.
  - **D8 [Researcher IMPORTANT]:** Part-V conclusion algorithm-count
    statement reconciled with Part-VI §29 (12 distinct numbered sections).
- **Wave N-completion Tier C7 — BE-36 R3 invalidation (Phys iter-4 IMPORTANT).**
  BE-36 (MOND — Dark Matter Interpolation, hybrid linear blend) promoted
  from 'speculative' to 'invalid' per R3 disposition. The hybrid linear
  blend `F = F_N μ(a/a_0) + F_DM (1 − μ(a/a_0))` is bespoke to this
  framework and not in any cited MOND literature. Standard MOND
  (Milgrom 1983 *Astrophys. J.* 270:365) uses `μ(a/a_0)·a = a_Newtonian`
  as an implicit single-acceleration relation, not a linear blend. Same
  defect class as the original BE-38 ansatz, which was reformulated to
  canonical Milgrom `μ(x) = x/√(1+x²)` in Wave I.B C4. Since BE-38 now
  covers canonical MOND, BE-36 has no remaining role and any salvage
  would duplicate BE-38. Status pin:
  `tests/bridges/be-36-r3-disposition.test.ts`.
- **Wave N-completion Tier C6 — BE-33 R3 invalidation (Phys iter-4 IMPORTANT).**
  BE-33 (Quantum-Classical Critical Point Mapping) promoted from
  'speculative' to 'invalid' per R3 disposition. Two coupled defects:
  (1) the ansatz `ξ_quantum(T) = ξ_classical / √(1 + (E_0/k_B T)²)` gives
  the wrong T → 0 limit (ξ → 0 instead of canonical Hertz-Millis
  divergence ξ ~ T^{-ν/z}); (2) the dynamic exponent z is absent from the
  displayed formula. Reformulation requires replacing the entire ansatz
  AND committing to a universality class (3D Ising / XY / Heisenberg /
  fermionic Hertz-Millis-Moriya); each gives different (ν, z). Two
  coupled physics decisions; neither is a transcription fix. Status pin:
  `tests/bridges/be-33-r3-disposition.test.ts`. Deleted obsolete
  `be-33-r2-spec.test.ts`.
- **Wave N Tier C5 — BE-24 R3 invalidation (Phys iter-4 IMPORTANT).** BE-24
  (Quantum Coherence in Photosynthesis Efficiency) promoted from
  'speculative' to 'invalid' per R3 disposition. Two orthogonal unfixable
  defects: (1) multiplicative form admits η > 1 for κ ∈ [0.1, 0.3] —
  bound-violation; not in any cited literature. (2) Cao 2020 *Sci. Adv.*
  consensus reassigns observed FMO oscillations as vibrational rather than
  electronic. Reformulation requires committing to FRET / HEOM / Lindblad
  AND addressing the vibrational reassignment. Status pin:
  `tests/bridges/be-24-r3-disposition.test.ts`. Deleted obsolete
  `be-24-r2-spec.test.ts`.
- **Wave N Tier C4 — BE-17 R3 invalidation (Phys iter-4 IMPORTANT).** BE-17
  (EM-Gravitational Torsion) promoted from 'speculative' to 'invalid' per
  R3 disposition. Three orthogonal structural defects (4-vs-2 index
  mismatch; ℓ_EM = √(ℏc/e²) not a length in SI; rank-3 vs rank-4
  contorsion confusion) each alone would warrant R3. Wave L Tier I8 had
  recorded the R3 evaluation but kept 'speculative' pending domain-expert
  review; Wave N Tier C4 promotes to 'invalid'. Status pin:
  `tests/bridges/be-17-r3-disposition.test.ts`. Deleted obsolete
  `be-17-preserve.test.ts` and `be-17-r2-spec.test.ts`.
- **Wave N Tier C3 — BE-15 R3 invalidation (Phys iter-4 IMPORTANT).** BE-15
  (Universal Emergence Equation) promoted from 'speculative' to 'invalid'
  per R3 disposition. LHS (∂O_macro/∂t, a macroscopic-observable rate) and
  RHS (F[{O_micro}], an RG-flow functional) describe disjoint physical
  objects evolving along different parameter axes (real time vs RG scale).
  Three non-equivalent literature reformulations exist (Hohenberg-Halperin
  / Wetterich / Mori-Zwanzig); selecting one is a research commitment.
  Status pin: `tests/bridges/be-15-r3-disposition.test.ts`. Deleted
  obsolete `be-15-r2-spec.test.ts`.
- **Wave N Tier C2 — BE-13 R3 invalidation (Phys iter-4 IMPORTANT).** BE-13
  (Landauer-Wheeler Information-Geometry Equation) promoted from
  'highly-speculative' to 'invalid' per R3 disposition. The "Landauer-
  Wheeler" framing is a category error — Landauer's principle is a 0+1-dim
  thermodynamic bound, not a stress-energy tensor sourcing curvature. The
  three canonical literature paths (Jacobson 1995 / Verlinde 2011 /
  Padmanabhan 2010) all *eliminate* I_μν rather than introduce it.
  Reformulation cannot patch the present form; each path gives a different
  equation. Status pin: `tests/bridges/be-13-r3-disposition.test.ts`.
  Deleted obsolete `be-13-r2-spec.test.ts`. Updated Part-I.md BE-13 Status
  block, Bridge-Remediation-Plan.md R3 record.
- **Wave N Tier C1 — BE-12 R3 invalidation (Phys iter-4 IMPORTANT).** BE-12
  (Mesoscopic Coherence Length) promoted from 'speculative' to 'invalid'
  per R3 disposition. Three orthogonal undefined-quantity defects (ξ_0,
  ω_decoherence, cube exponent in N_c) require coupled physics judgments
  that no domain-expert reformulation arrived for in the iter-3→iter-4
  window. Status pin: `tests/bridges/be-12-r3-disposition.test.ts`. Deleted
  obsolete `be-12-preserve.test.ts` and `be-12-r2-spec.test.ts`. Updated

### Fixed
- **Wave N Tier B — BE-19 ρ_crit prefactor reconciliation (Math IMP-1 +
  Researcher I-3 iter-4 CONV-1).** The Wave-I.B-C1 reformulation displayed
  `ρ_crit = √3 / (16π²γ³ℓ_P²) · c²/G`, which with γ=0.2375 evaluates to
  ~0.82 ρ_Planck — but the prose claim everywhere has been ρ_crit ≈
  0.41 ρ_Planck (matching Ashtekar-Pawlowski-Singh 2006 PRD 74:084003 and
  the Ashtekar-Singh 2011 review arXiv:1108.0893). Resolved by changing
  the displayed prefactor from `16π²γ³` to `32π²γ³` (canonical APS form);
  the prose value 0.41 ρ_Planck is preserved because it was already
  correct. Updated `formula_latex` and `notes` in `src/bridges/index.ts`,
  the displayed equation in `docs/specification/Part-I.md` BE-19 (with
  retrospective correction note), and the BE-19 encoding test
  `tests/bridges/be-19-encoding.test.ts` (PINS canonical APS form
  description and the dimensionless-coefficient bracket [0.35, 0.50]
  that pins the 0.41 numerical claim).
- **Wave N Tier A6 — BE-30 FLM venue typo (Researcher iter-4 C2).** BE-30
  R3 disposition cited Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena 2013 as
  "*JHEP* 1408:074"; the canonical venue is **JHEP 11:074 (2013)**,
  matching BE-43's reference form. Fixed in `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-30
  references[] (line ~797) and `docs/specification/Part-II.md` BE-30
  Status block (with retrospective venue-correction note dated 2026-05-06).
- **Wave N Tier A5 — BE-40 author attribution (Researcher iter-4 C1).**
  arXiv:hep-ph/0703164 ("The Strongly-Interacting Light Higgs", *JHEP*
  0706:045) was previously mis-attributed to
  "Contino-Grojean-Moretti-Piccinini-Rattazzi 2007"; the canonical author
  list is **Giudice-Grojean-Pomarol-Rattazzi 2007** (verified against the
  arXiv abstract). Fixed in `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-40 entry (references
  + comment), Part-II.md BE-40 prose + corrected-on block, and CHANGELOG
  Wave J Tier C5 retrospective note.

### Changed
- **Wave N Tier A2 — REPAIR_INCONSISTENCY clearly schema-only (CS iter-4
  C2).** Strengthened the Algorithm 1 hedge note in Part-I §IV with a loud
  WARNING block that says: no termination guarantee, no implementation,
  schema-only — and added a parallel new sub-section Part-IV §12.2.1.2
  ("REPAIR_INCONSISTENCY is schema-only — no implementation, no
  termination guarantee") that ties the schema to the audit-tier
  R0/R1/R2/R3 dispositioning system + hand-applied repair waves
  (Waves F–N) as the actual repair workflow.
- **Wave N Tier A1+A3+A4 — Part-III §VIII complexity-formalism cleanup
  (CS iter-4 C1 + C3 + C4).** Struck the formal-looking class chain
  `P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ TENSOR ⊆ EXPSPACE ⊆ ELEMENTARY` and the
  **TENSOR-COMPLETE** problem list ("Bridge Equation Satisfiability,"
  etc.) per the option-(b) recommendation in CS iter-4 reviewer comments.
  Replaced with prose acknowledging the satisfiability question is
  *informally analogous* to SAT but UPT does not commit to a complexity
  classification; concrete tractability information lives on each
  `BridgeEquation`'s `tractability_class` field, and the canonical
  classification is the tree-width story in Part-V §XXV.1.1
  (Markov-Shi 2008). Algorithm 6's LINEAR/QUADRATIC/EXPONERTIAL hedge
  note rewritten to declare those labels schematic placeholders for the
  tree-width framing rather than a competing classification. Part-III
  preamble status note updated to reflect the deletion and Algorithm
  3/3A/3B reconciliation completion.
- **Wave L Tier J — minor polish (Math + Phys + Researcher MINOR iter-3).**
  - **Glossary expansion (Math iter-3 minor):** added entries for `T`
    (temperature vs stress-energy tensor vs time collisions across BE-11/12/
    13/15/23/26/27/29/33/34 vs BE-30/43/29 vs BE-50/§1.3), `n` (mutation
    rate vs defect density vs species number density), `k` (Lindblad sum
    index vs Boltzmann constant `k_B` vs mode index), and `α_fs`
    (fine-structure constant disambiguated from per-bridge α coefficients).
  - **§3.1 CPT clarification (Math iter-3 minor):** added a clarification
    note that `CPT : Π → Π + O(ℓ_P/L)` reads CPT as an operation on per-cell
    quantum-field content (not as the identity on Π), consistent with the
    per-cell reading of §1.3 invariants. Tied to the catalog-framing
    commitment in §1.1.
  - BE-44 supertranslation/superrotation Y^z (Math iter-3) — applied in
    Tier I6 above.
  - Algorithm 6 LINEAR/QUADRATIC/EXPONENTIAL — already has Wave J Tier E4
    hedge note in Part-III §VIII; no further action.
- **Wave L Tier I — per-bridge clarifications (Math IMPORTANT + Phys IMPORTANT iter-3).**
  - **I1 BE-22 α-dimension circularity flag (Phys I3 iter-3):** new
    known_issue documenting that the AST encoding's `[1]` round-trip is
    only valid when α is *given* dimension `[L^{-1}]` a priori; the d=2
    spatial-dimension assumption is inferred from α's dimension, not
    independently specified.
  - **I2 BE-29 Hilbert action specifics (Phys I2 iter-3):** new known_issue
    making explicit that the gravitational-work term uses the
    Einstein-Hilbert action variation per MTW §21.3 / Wald §E.1, with
    explicit T^{μν} := (2/√(-g))·δ(√(-g)L_matter)/δg_{μν}, and that
    Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms are not included.
  - **I3 BE-32 measure unspecified (Phys I5 iter-3):** new known_issue
    flagging that the dg integral presupposes a Haar measure but no group
    is specified, and Haar measures diverge for non-compact groups
    (translations, boosts) without regularization.
  - **I4 BE-34 dimensional fix completed in formula (Phys I6 iter-3):**
    `formula_latex` updated to include the explicit `1/a^d` prefactor
    (previously only documented in glossary; the formula_latex itself
    omitted it). LHS dimensions `[L]^(-d)` now recovered. Part-II §BE-34
    prose Status block updated.
  - **I5 BE-39 "universal" → "scheme-dependent" coefficients (Phys I7
    iter-3):** new known_issue clarifying that A, B, C, D, E in the
    truncated β-functions are scheme-dependent (Einstein-Hilbert / f(R) /
    Wetterich-type / regulator / gauge-fixing), not universal. Reuter-Weyer
    2009 truncation values cited as canonical scheme.
  - **I6 BE-44 supertranslation/superrotation Y^z disambiguation (Math
    iter-3 + Phys M4):** new known_issue specifying that Y^z is the
    superrotation form (vector field on celestial sphere); supertranslation
    case has Y^z replaced by scalar f(z, z̄). Hawking-Perry-Strominger 2017
    cited.
  - **I7 BE-12 R3 evaluation (Math iter-3 IMPORTANT):** new known_issue
    documenting that ξ_0, ω_decoherence, and the cube exponent in N_c
    constitute a structural defect; Wave L decision is to **keep
    'speculative'** rather than R3-disposition (formula serves as a
    placeholder; demoting would lose it without offering an alternative).
  - **I8 BE-17 R3 evaluation (Math iter-3 IMPORTANT):** new known_issue
    documenting the three orthogonal structural defects (4-vs-2 indices,
    l_EM not a length, rank-4 vs rank-3 contorsion); Wave L decision is to
    **keep 'speculative'** as a research-program placeholder.
  - **Test update:** `tests/bridges/be-17-preserve.test.ts` known_issues
    count assertion 3 → 4 (Wave L Tier I8 added a 4th entry; all remain
    'reformulation'-fixable).
- **Wave L Tier H — citation hygiene continuation.**
  - **H1 (4 empty `references[]` populated, per Researcher iter-3 I-3):**
    BE-23 (Strange Metal — historical citation chain retained despite R3
    invalidation: Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford 2016, Sachdev-Ye 1993,
    Hartnoll 2015), BE-34 (Kibble-Zurek: Kibble 1976, Zurek 1985, del Campo
    & Zurek 2014), BE-46 (Multiverse measure: Linde-Linde-Mezhlumian 1994,
    Vilenkin 1995, Garriga-Vilenkin 2001, Freivogel 2011), BE-48 (GRW:
    Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber 1986, Bassi-Ghirardi 2003, Bassi et al. 2013).
  - **H2 Verlinde SciPost year (2016 → 2017):** SciPost Phys. 2:016 was
    published in 2017 although the arXiv submission (1611.02269) was 2016.
    Updated in Part-II §BE-36 prose, src/bridges/index.ts BE-36
    references[], and BE-36 known_issue description.
  - **H3 Part-V conclusion BE-list (line 1218 stale):** the hard-coded BE
    list at "Correct the known equation errors..." was inconsistent with
    HEAD. Replaced with a forward pointer to `src/bridges/index.ts` (the
    source of truth) plus the current count (27, Wave L Tier F2) and a
    note that 7 are R3-invalid.
  - **H4 Glossary cross-reference fix:** "A | Part-I §3.2, §11.1.2" →
    "Part-I §3.2, Part-IV §11.1.2" (the earlier reference was malformed —
    §11.1.2 lives in Part-IV, not Part-I). Per Researcher iter-3 I-1.
- **Wave L Tier G — Wave J E/G residuals.**
  - **G1 Part-III §VIII heading:** "Information-Theoretic Bounds and
    Complexity Analysis" → "Catalog Tractability and Information-Theoretic
    Bounds" (per CS C3 iter-3) — applied in Tier A above; the formal-class
    language was already hedged informal in Wave I.B D6 / Wave J Tier E1 and
    the heading is now aligned.
  - **G2 tractability_class population (10 new entries, per CS C2 iter-3):**
    BE-12 → 'formally-divergent' (novel formula; no literature derivation),
    BE-13 → 'formally-divergent' (Landauer-Wheeler I_μν not constructible
    per Phys C2),
    BE-15 → 'formally-divergent' (RG functional + observable mix; no
    operational form per Phys C3),
    BE-17 → 'formally-divergent' (Einstein-Cartan with rank-mismatched EM
    coupling),
    BE-21 → 'closed-form' (AdS/CMT Green's function with explicit
    dimensional signature, computable at tree level),
    BE-27 → 'numerical-tractable' (frequency-domain susceptibility from
    MD/Langevin simulations),
    BE-28 → 'formally-divergent' (variational principle ill-posed without
    constraint surface, per Phys I4),
    BE-32 → 'formally-divergent' (Haar measure undefined for non-compact
    groups, per Phys I5),
    BE-35 → 'numerical-tractable' (conformal bootstrap is a numerical SDP
    procedure tractable in practice),
    BE-44 → 'numerical-tractable' (soft-hair surface integrals are
    numerically computable per remediation-plan note).
    Remaining 'undefined' entries are intentionally undefined for now
    (BE-43, BE-50: now R3-invalid; BE-30, BE-37, BE-23, BE-16: also
    R3-invalid; the rest still need physics-judgment input).
  - **G3 Part-VI §28.3 speculative-algorithms warning header:** added per
    Math M-I6 iter-2 (propagated from Part-IV §12.3 / Wave J Tier E3
    pattern). Cosmic-engineering subsections now carry an explicit
    speculative-pseudocode warning header in addition to the prior
    "IMPORTANT CAVEAT" block.
  - **G4 Definition 8.1 distribution clarification:** applied in Tier A
    above (uniform-on-populated explicit; alternatives Gibbs, MaxEnt,
    empirical-mass listed).
- **Wave L Tier F — regressions caught (Researcher iter-3).**
  - **F1 Israeli-Goldenfeld year:** corrected `2006 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 92:074105`
    → `2004 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 92:074105`. Wave I.B D5 introduced the wrong
    year when adding the reference. Verified via APS, PubMed, arXiv:nlin/0309047.
    Updated Part-IV §11.2.1 line 174 and CHANGELOG references (Wave I.B D5
    entry).
  - **F2 known_issues count off-by-one:** Part-VI line 714 (count "26") and
    line 729 (list with BE-19 stale) were inconsistent with Wave I.A C3 fix
    that only touched CHANGELOG line 320. Both Part-VI lines now corrected
    to count 27 with BE-19 → BE-26 and BE-29 added to the list (BE-29 was
    previously missed; it carries a Wave J Tier D4 known_issue). CHANGELOG
    line 636 entry similarly corrected 26 → 27 with BE-29 added.
- **Wave L Tier E — R3 dispositions (BE-25 cascade, BE-43, BE-50).**
  Three new R3 invalid dispositions per iter-3 Phys CRITICAL findings (C4, C7, C8).
  - **E1 (BE-43, Phys C7 iter-3):** wormhole length DECREASES with entanglement
    (sign backwards from Maldacena-Susskind ER=EPR), plus dimensional
    malformedness (entropy + stress-energy integral cannot combine into
    length/time without unphysical coefficient roles). Same structural-
    malformedness pattern as already-invalidated BE-30 (Wave J Tier B2).
    Recommended replacement: FLM 2013 entanglement-wedge construction.
    Status: 'highly-speculative' → 'invalid'. Two known_issues marked
    'unfixable-must-mark-invalid'.
  - **E2 (BE-50, Phys C8 iter-3):** δ⁴(x − x_m) action term variationally
    ill-posed. Single-point distributional source produces non-finite-action
    EOM solutions, boundary conditions for backward sector unspecified, no
    stress-energy tensor or Hamiltonian. Genuine Wheeler-Feynman absorber
    theory integrates over absorber world-lines, not a single point. Status:
    'highly-speculative' → 'invalid'. New unfixable known_issue added; prior
    Wave I.A C5 attribution context retained.
  - **E3 (BE-25 cascade, Phys C4 iter-3 — completes deferred Wave J Tier B3):**
    BE-25 (Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR) dispositioned R3-invalid on two
    orthogonal grounds: (1) Tegmark 2000 *Phys. Rev. E* 61:4194 decoherence-
    time falsification (10-order gap microtubule ~10⁻¹³ s vs cognition
    ~10⁻³ s); (2) formula's spurious Δx/ℓ_P factor not in Penrose's canonical
    E_G ~ G(Δm)²/Δx. Cascade: **excised three downstream sections** — Part-IV
    §12.3 (Consciousness Engineering pseudocode + ENGINEER_CONSCIOUSNESS
    algorithm), Part-V §21.2.2 (CONSCIOUSNESS_STATE_MONITOR device specs),
    Part-VI §28.2 (clinical-protocol pseudocode for Depression / ADHD / PTSD /
    Alzheimer's / Anesthesia + Cognitive Augmentation). Each excision leaves
    a one-paragraph replacement noting that future quantum-cognition claims
    require a separate validated mechanistic basis (e.g., IIT/PCI as suggested
    by the iter-1 Neurologist).
  - **Tests:** 3 new R3 status-pin test files (be-25/43/50-r3-disposition.test.ts)
    mirroring the BE-30/37 templates. Updated stale BE-25 status pin in
    be-25-encoding.test.ts (was pinning 'highly-speculative'; now 'invalid').
  - **Documents updated:** Part-II BE-25/43/50 prose Status blocks all reflect
    R3 disposition with cross-references to test files.
    Bridge-Remediation-Plan.md R3 row count 4 → 7 with new entries listed.
- **Wave L Tier D — Wave J Tier A residuals (catalog-framing follow-up).**
  Per CONV-4 iter-3 (Math C1, CS C1, Phys implicit) — Wave J Tier A scope-note
  approach left three residuals.
  - **D1 §1.2 vs §3.3 `+` ambiguity:** the `+` in `Π = L + B + E` (§1.2) is
    disjoint union of catalog entries; the `+` in the §3.3 RG-flow expansion
    `β_0 + β_1 Π + β_2 Π² + …` is algebraic-polynomial inside per-cell coupling
    content. Same character, different operations. Both §1.2 and §3.3 now carry
    a clarification note explicitly disambiguating these and stating that there
    is no aggregate algebraic operation on the catalog as a whole.
  - **D2 §1.3 invariant 1 (dimensional consistency) clarified as self-consistency
    check:** per Math C2 iter-3, the AST-validator-level check is a
    necessary-but-not-sufficient self-consistency assertion (the encoding is
    consistent with its declared signature), not a derivation of physics from
    first principles. The physics-level dimensional correctness is enforced by
    the per-BE `references[]` field plus prose. Note added to invariant 1.
  - **D3 Algorithm 3A scope note:** added in Wave L Tier B (above) — every
    Hilbert-space-style operation in the algorithm body is now schematic, with
    the per-cell catalog rewrite documented in Appendix B (Part-IV).
- **Wave L Tier C — Consistency matrix C_ij entry-construction recipe (2-way convergent CRITICAL per iter-3).**
  Per CONV-3 iter-3 (Math C3 + Phys C5), the balance-theoretic check (Harary 1953,
  Wave J Tier C6) is well-defined structurally but operationally empty without a
  recipe for assigning the actual `C_ij ∈ {-1, 0, +1}` values to the 780
  off-diagonal pairs.
  - **Added Part-II §6.2.1 "Entry-construction recipe — illustrative":**
    candidate recipe based on shared fundamental constants, symbol-family overlap,
    and dimensional compatibility; explicit caveats that the recipe is
    illustrative, not authoritative, and that full population requires per-pair
    physics judgment.
  - **Two worked example pairs:**
    - BE-11 (Caldeira-Leggett decoherence) vs BE-19 (LQC bounce) → `C_{11,19} = 0`
      (operationally independent: shared `ℏ` is too marginal, dimensional
      categories differ, no mutual prediction).
    - BE-22 (entanglement-entropy area scaling) vs BE-14 (Ryu-Takayanagi) →
      `C_{22,14} = +1` (mutually reinforcing: BE-22 is the (1+1)D limit of BE-14
      RT formula).
  - **Part-V §19.2 cross-reference:** added a forward pointer to Part-II §6.2.1
    so the balance-theoretic check is now reachable from both halves of the spec
    via the same recipe.
- **Wave L Tier B — Hilbert-space sketches relegated to Appendix B (3-way convergent CRITICAL per iter-3).**
  Per CONV-2 iter-3 (Math C5, CS I4 + C1, Phys partial), three reviewers found the
  Wave J Tier A scope-note approach insufficient: tensor-style operations on `Π`
  (`⟨Πᵢ|Πⱼ⟩`, `Tr[Π†OΠ]`, `‖Π‖_F`, `‖Π_∞‖²`, `lim_{ℏ→0} Π_quantum`, functor `F: 𝒫 → ℋ`,
  `⊗_{n=0}^∞ ℋ_n`, `⟨ψ, Dψ⟩`) continued to read as operational inside algorithm bodies
  and displayed formulas because the existing scope notes were paragraphs away.
  Wave L Tier B chose **Option B (relegation)** over Option A (cleanup):
  - **Added Part-IV Appendix B "Hilbert-Space Analogies (Non-Load-Bearing)":**
    catalogues every body occurrence of Hilbert-space-style notation, gives the
    per-cell catalog rewrite for each (table B.1), and indexes by body location
    (table B.2). Single-named relegation point; Option B chosen because Option A
    (per-cell rewriting throughout) would require extensive prose rewrite that
    risks losing expository value.
  - **Body scope notes strengthened:** Part-I §Algorithm 3A (NEW scope note),
    Part-IV §11.1.1 / §11.1.2 (NEW or strengthened), §14.1.3 (NEW),
    Part-V §17.1 / §17.2 / §17.3 / §24.1.1 (strengthened) — each now points
    explicitly to "Appendix B (Part-IV)" so a reader who lands inside a body
    formula can immediately find the operational catalog meaning.
  - **Algorithm 3A schematic rendering:** the body's `‖Π - transformed‖_F` and
    `lim_{ℏ→0} Π_quantum = Π_classical` are now explicitly tagged as schematic;
    the operational form (per-cell, identical to the rephrased Part-I §1.3
    invariant 4 from Wave J) is documented in the new scope note. The implemented
    validator (`VALIDATE_DIMENSIONS` in `src/dimensional/validator.ts`) operates
    per-cell already.
  - **§11.1.2 holographic bound aligned with Tier A:** the `I ≤ A/(4ℓ_P²)`
    holographic-information bound is now cross-referenced to the new
    Hubble-horizon form `A_H = 4π/H₀²` per Conjecture 8.1 in Part-III §VIII
    (Wave L Tier A; Phys I9 iter-3).
- **Wave L Tier A — Conjecture 8.1 comprehensive rewrite (3-way convergent CRITICAL per iter-3).**
  Per CONV-1 iter-3 (Math C4 + CS C4/C5 + Phys C1), Part-III §VIII Conjecture 8.1
  comprehensively rewritten:
  - **Hubble-horizon area replaces `A_universe`:** the previous form invoked
    `A_universe / (4ℓ_P²)`, which is a category error — there is no global
    cosmological boundary in dS-like spacetime. Replaced with the
    Gibbons-Hawking de Sitter horizon area `A_H = 4π / H₀²`
    (Gibbons-Hawking 1977 *Phys. Rev. D* 15:2738), associated with the cosmic
    event horizon of a comoving observer. The displayed inequality now reads
    `I(Π) ≤ max(0, A_H/(4ℓ_P²) − S_entanglement[H_3])`.
  - **`H_3` replaces `∂ universe`:** the entanglement-entropy correction is now
    taken across the spatial 3-slice intersected with the Hubble horizon
    (`H_3`), replacing the ill-defined `∂ universe`.
  - **Positivity floor `max(0, …)`:** the previous unclamped difference
    `A_H/(4ℓ_P²) − S_entanglement[H_3]` could in principle be negative
    (CS C5); positivity in dS is itself a sub-conjecture, not a derived
    inequality. The `max(0, …)` clamp ensures a structural floor of zero.
  - **Quantitative-triviality caveat made explicit:** under the
    uniform-on-populated pin (Definition 8.1), `I(Π) ≈ 5.32 bits` while the
    RHS is ~10¹²² bits — the bound is so loose it carries no quantitative
    content at present catalog resolution. The conjecture is now explicitly
    framed as a **structural** statement, not an operational test condition
    (Math C4, CS C4 iter-3).
  - **§VIII heading reformulated:** "Information-Theoretic Bounds and
    Complexity Analysis" → "Catalog Tractability and Information-Theoretic
    Bounds" (Wave L Tier G1, per CS C3 iter-3) — the formal-class language
    was already hedged informal in Wave I.B D6 / Wave J Tier E1; the heading
    is now aligned.
  - **Definition 8.1 distribution made explicit:** the uniform-on-populated
    pin now states explicit alternatives (Gibbs, MaxEnt, empirical-mass)
    that the spec does not commit to (Wave L Tier G4, per Math C4 iter-3).
- **Wave J Tier H — minor polish.**
  Per iter-2 Math M-M1, M-M3, M-M4 + Phys M6:
  - **BE-19 ρ_crit parenthesization:** added explicit parentheses to disambiguate
    `(√3/(16π²γ³ℓ_P²)) · (c²/G)` from the alternative reading.
  - **BE-44 zar{z} → \bar{z}:** the alt-text was corrupted by three `\x08` (backspace) bytes
    that turned `\bar{z}` into `zar{z}` in three places. Fixed via byte-level rewrite.
    Strengthened where-clause to define `N_{z\bar{z}} := ∂_u C_{z\bar{z}}` matching standard
    Bondi-Strominger convention.
  - **BE-20 inline-vs-prose mismatch:** displayed inline LaTeX previously rendered `n ≥ 2`
    while alt-text and prose said `n > 0`. The prose is correct (any `n > 0` makes
    `exp(-(x/x_c)^n)` faster-than-polynomial); replaced inline LaTeX with `n > 0`.
  - **Algorithm 3A/3B duplicate numbering:** already disambiguated in earlier waves
    ("Algorithm 3B extends Part-I Algorithm 3A"); confirmed not a duplicate; no further
    action.
  - **Bekenstein 1981 vs Bekenstein-Hawking 1973 conflation:** addressed in Tier D8
    (§12.2.2 restructure) where Bekenstein's universal bound `S ≤ 2π k_B R E /(ℏc)` is
    distinguished from the Bekenstein-Hawking area form `A/(4ℓ_P²)`.
- **Wave J Tier F + G — references[] population and tractability_class population.**
  - **Tier F (10 entries):** populated `references[]` from prose-Status citations for BE-23
    (R3 dispositioned in Tier B; FLM added), BE-27, BE-32, BE-35, BE-36, BE-39, BE-40 (already
    in Tier C5), BE-42, BE-44, BE-49. Each new reference includes a brief annotation indicating
    which content it grounds. Per Researcher iter-2 finding I-3.
  - **Tier G (5 entries):** populated `tractability_class` for entries with clear literature
    tractability:
    - BE-20 (vacuum-fluctuation dark energy) → `'formally-divergent'` (the integral is the
      cosmological-constant problem; ~10^120-off naive evaluation).
    - BE-46 (multiverse measure problem) → `'formally-divergent'` (path-integral measure dμ[g,φ]
      not Turing-computable; the measure is itself the unsolved problem).
    - BE-50 (retrocausal QFT) → `'formally-divergent'` (distributional δ⁴(x - x_m) coupling in
      the action; both-sector path integral not Turing-computable).
    - BE-29 (Jarzynski-gravity) → `'numerical-tractable'` (already applied in Tier D4).
    - BE-39 (asymptotic safety) → `'numerical-tractable'` (already applied in Tier F via the
      truncated functional RG flow).
- **Wave J Tier E — algorithmic spec hedges.**
  Per iter-2 reviewer findings (CS C1, C3, C4, C8, I2, I5, I8; Math M-I3, M-I4):
  - **E1:** TENSOR-COMPLETE / `P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ TENSOR ⊆ EXPSPACE` chain — strengthened the
    Wave I.B D6 hedge note in Part-III §VIII to apply explicitly to ALL body usages of
    "TENSOR-COMPLETE" or the chain. Body chain header now reads "(informal, illustrative — not
    formal)". Per CS C3.
  - **E2:** Algorithm 1 (`INFER_BRIDGE_EQUATIONS`, `REPAIR_INCONSISTENCY`) — added prominent
    "Hedge note" header tagging the algorithm as a schema, not an algorithm; flagged
    uncomputable subroutines as **ORACLE** calls; clarified that only `VALIDATE_DIMENSIONS` is
    actually implemented. Per CS C1.
  - **E3:** Speculative `ENGINEER_*` algorithms (Part-IV §12.3, §12.4, §13.2) — added a
    front-loaded "Speculative-algorithms warning header" at the start of §12.3 covering all
    such blocks. Tagged as expository sketches, not implementable. Per CS C4.
  - **E4:** Algorithm 6 LINEAR/QUADRATIC/EXPONENTIAL classification — added Hedge note
    pointing to Part-V §XXV.1.1 treewidth framing as the principled alternative; classification
    marked schematic until pinned to concrete tensor-network properties. Per CS I2.
  - **E5:** "Theorem 8.1" Holographic Bound — relabeled **Conjecture 8.1**; "Proof Sketch" →
    "Plausibility Argument"; each step annotated with its non-rigor (Bekenstein 1981 vs
    Bekenstein-Hawking 1973 conflation; RT applies in AdS not dS; inclusion-exclusion over
    cosmological patches non-rigorous). Per Math M-I3.
  - **E6:** Definition 8.1 Tensor Information Content — added "Distribution-pin note" stating
    the spec assumes the **uniform-on-populated-cells** distribution; alternative distributions
    (e.g., empirical mass via confidence_score) are out of scope. Per Math M-I4.
  - **E7:** §III.2.4 (Part-I §3.2 item 4) — strengthened the "no UPT-committed bound" hedge:
    no general upper bound on circuit complexity in terms of entropy alone is possible
    (entropy is unitary-invariant; circuit complexity is not; cannot be related by a
    state-independent function). Per CS I5.
  - **E8:** §1.3 modal "must satisfy" language — weakened to "is checked by the dimensional
    validator for the AST-encoded subset; un-encoded equations are unchecked." The validator's
    actual scope is bounded (dimensional_signature for AST-encoded entries); gauge / unitarity
    / correspondence are content-level and not machine-checked. Per CS C8 + I8.
- **Wave J Tier D — notation/scope/glossary completeness pass.**
  Per iter-2 reviewer findings (Math M-I1, M-I2, M-C2, M-C3, M-I6, Phys C7, CS C5, CS C6, Math/CS I1):
  - **D1 (already in Tier A commit):** Part-I §1.3 invariants 2-4 rephrased as per-cell validator
    contracts mirroring Item 1's pattern.
  - **D2:** Notation glossary in Part-I Appendix A extended with 7 missing polyvalent symbols
    (σ, A, S, F, g, H, a) per Math M-I1. Each row pins which BE uses the symbol in which sense.
  - **D3:** BE-22 known_issues — added "Spatial-dimension scope" entry noting the Kitaev-Preskill
    formula `S(R) = αL − γ` implicitly fixes d=2 (perimeter L, α [L^{-1}]); higher-d generalizes
    to area `[L^{d-1}]` and `α [L^{-(d-1)}]`. Per Math M-C2.
  - **D4:** BE-29 known_issues — added "Factorization assumption" entry: the Jarzynski-gravity
    factorization ⟨exp(-βW)⟩ = exp(-βΔF)·exp(-βW_grav) requires W_grav to be deterministic
    (external protocol metric) or self-averaging; spec is now explicit that δg_{μν} is the
    deterministic experimentalist-imposed protocol. Per Math M-C3 + Phys I10. Bonus: updated
    `tractability_class` from `'undefined'` to `'numerical-tractable'` (anticipates Tier G).
  - **D5:** BE-13 known_issues — added "Landauer attribution mismatch" entry: only the
    k_B T ln 2 prefactor is Landauer-derived; the curvature-generating I_μν tensor and its
    sourcing of Einstein's equations is a separate ansatz that should be relabeled
    "Landauer-inspired" or rederived via Padmanabhan 2010 emergent-gravity. Per CS C5.
    Added Padmanabhan 2010 to references[]. Per Math M-I10.
  - **D6:** BE-22 known_issues — added "Log-base convention" entry: S(R) is in **nats**;
    γ = ln(D); to convert to bits multiply by 1/ln(2). Per CS C6.
  - **D7:** Part-IV §11.2.1 — replaced the formal cardinality claim `|𝒞(Π)| < |𝒰(Π)|` with a
    runtime/algorithmic-cost framing. The cardinality formalism is finite-vs-finite under §1.1
    (Π is a finite catalog) and "strict and unbridgeable" has no clear meaning there; the
    irreducibility content is about shortcut-vs-direct-simulation cost inside cell-content
    dynamics, not about catalog cardinality. Per Math M-M9 + CS I1.
  - **D8:** Part-IV §12.2.2 — replaced the conflation "Computational Power ≤ (E·T/ℏ)·(V/ℓ_P³)"
    (which mislabeled an op-count as power AND used V/ℓ_P³ where Bekenstein gives A/ℓ_P²) with
    three separately-stated bounds: Margolus-Levitin power bound (2E/πℏ ops/sec); Lloyd
    cosmic-ops total bound; Bekenstein-Bousso entropy ≤ A/(4ℓ_P²) holographic bound. Per
    Math M-I6.
- **Wave J Tier C — tracker drift fixes + BE-40 dimensional fix + §6.2/§19.2 SUPERSEDED reconciliation.**
  Per iter-2 Researcher findings (C1-C4) + Phys C-NEW + CONV-2:
  - **C1 (verified via WebFetch arXiv abstract page):** Son-Starinets 2002 venue corrected
    `Phys. Rev. D 65:104021` → `JHEP 0209:042` (3 locations: Part-II.md BE-21 status block,
    `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-21 references, CHANGELOG.md). The Wave I.A pass mistakenly
    recorded the wrong venue when disambiguating from the three-author Policastro paper.
  - **C2:** Iqbal & Liu citation year `2008` → `2009` (arXiv 0903.2596 is March 2009;
    *Fortsch. Phys.* 57 is the 2009 volume).
  - **C3:** Stale prose known-issue lists at Part-VI.md:848 and CHANGELOG.md:381 swapped
    BE-19 → BE-26. Wave I.B C1 emptied BE-19's `known_issues[]` (reformulation cleared
    the gap stub); Wave I.B C6 added the polymerase-fidelity issue to BE-26.
  - **C4:** `Bridge-Remediation-Plan.md` summary table updated R3 count `0 → 4` and R2
    count `9 → 7` to reflect Wave J Tier B (BE-23, BE-30) + Wave-pre-J (BE-37) + 2026-05-01
    (BE-16) R3 dispositions. Added Tier R3 detail entries for BE-23 and BE-30.
  - **C5 (per Phys C-NEW iter-2 + Phys I7 iter-2):** BE-40 first-term coefficient
    `-α f²` → `-α f⁴` for dimensional homogeneity. Standard composite-Higgs potentials
    (Kaplan-Georgi 1984; Giudice-Grojean-Pomarol-Rattazzi 2007 — see Wave N Tier A5 for
    the author-attribution correction; this earlier entry mis-attributed the arXiv ID) have
    V(h) = α f⁴ sin² + β f⁴ sin⁴ with both α, β dimensionless. Updated `formula_latex`
    in `src/bridges/index.ts`, the displayed equation in Part-II.md, and the status text;
    populated BE-40 `references[]` (3 entries).
  - **C6 (per CONV-2 + Phys C6 + Math M-I8):** §6.2 / §19.2 SUPERSEDED reconciliation.
    Both sections now point to the **balance-theoretic** replacement as the canonical
    operational checker; the Gram-form alternative is retired (the embedding was
    unspecified, leaving the check parametric per Math M-I8). Pinned `C_ii := +1`
    diagonal convention. (Tier A commit added the §19.2 update; this commit completes
    the §6.2 cross-reference to commit to a single replacement form.)
- **Wave J Tier B1 — BE-23 (Strange Metal — Black Hole Duality) R3 mark-invalid disposition.**
  Per Phys iter-1 C2 + Math M-I5 iter-2 paper review. The third term
  `B √(ℏ/(k_B T τ_P))` collapses to `B · 1` identically because `τ_P · k_B T = ℏ` is a
  definitional identity, so any monomial built from those two scales alone is fixed.
  The displayed formula has the same content as `ρ(T) = ρ_0 + B + AT` — constant-shifted
  Drude form, not Planckian dissipation. Promoted from R2 to R3 invalid: a non-vacuous
  third term must introduce a second scale (τ_el, SYK J, E_F, MSS λ_L), which is a
  research commitment rather than a transcription fix. Status `'speculative'` →
  `'invalid'`; `KnownIssue.fixable` → `'unfixable-must-mark-invalid'`. Notes lead with
  "INVALID per disposition decision 2026-05-05 (Wave J Tier B1)". Spec section update
  at Part-II BE-23. Status-pin test at `tests/bridges/be-23-r3-disposition.test.ts`
  (replaces obsolete `be-23-fix.test.ts` R2-pin). Bridge-Remediation-Plan.md updated.
- **Wave J Tier B2 — BE-30 (ER=EPR / Entanglement-Geometry) R3 mark-invalid disposition.**
  Per Math M-C5 + Phys C5 iter-1, re-flagged iter-2. The displayed equation has four
  orthogonal defects: (a) `Tr_j(ρ_{ij} log ρ_{ij})` is a scalar so `⟨x|...|x⟩` is
  undefined on it; (b) LHS rank-2 vs RHS scalar — index mismatch; (c) `|x⟩`
  non-normalizable; (d) κ·S has units [L]² but δg_{μν} should be dimensionless.
  No consistent reading. The canonical replacement is the Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena
  2013 (arXiv:1307.2892) linear-response formula `δS_EE = ⟨δH_R⟩`, which is a *different*
  equation, not a fix. Status `'highly-speculative'` → `'invalid'`; both `KnownIssue`
  entries promoted to `'unfixable-must-mark-invalid'`. Notes lead with "INVALID per
  disposition decision 2026-05-05 (Wave J Tier B2)". Spec section update at Part-II
  BE-30. Status-pin test at `tests/bridges/be-30-r3-disposition.test.ts`. Added FLM
  reference. Bridge-Remediation-Plan.md updated.
- **Wave J Tier A — committed to "labeled multi-index catalog" framing for `Π` throughout the spec.**
  Three independent fresh-eyes reviewers (iter-2 Math M-C1, Phys C7, CS C2) re-rediscovered the
  long-running incoherence: §1.1 demoted `Π` to a labeled multi-index catalog (no inner product,
  `+` is disjoint union), but downstream sections (Part-IV §11.1.1 `⟨Π_i|Π_j⟩` / `Tr[Π†OΠ]`,
  Part-V §17.1 functor-to-**Hilb**, §17.2 `Π = ⊗ℋ_n`, §17.3 spectral triple, §24.1.1 `‖Π_∞‖² < ∞`)
  used genuine Hilbert-space structure on `Π`. To stop the loop from rediscovering this every
  iteration, the framing is committed unambiguously: `Π` has no inner product, no global norm,
  no functorial Hilbert-space codomain, no aggregate `ℏ → 0` limit. Per-section impacts:
  - Part-I §1.1: promoted the demotion from caveat to definition; section title is now "Tensor
    Definition (labeled multi-index catalog)"; added a "Framing commitment" preamble pointing all
    affected sections back to §1.1.
  - Part-I §1.3: rephrased Items 2-4 (Gauge Invariance, Unitarity, Correspondence Principle) as
    per-cell validator contracts mirroring the Wave I.B D11 pattern for Item 1. The earlier
    compact equations on `Π`-as-a-whole were vacuous as top-level invariants; the per-equation
    reading is the operational one.
  - Part-IV §11.1.1: strengthened the existing scope note to a "Catalog-framing scope note"
    explicitly tagging `|Π_i⟩`, `⟨Π_i|Π_j⟩`, `Tr[Π†OΠ]` as notational analogies retained for
    historical/expository continuity, NOT operational mathematical objects.
  - Part-V §17.1, §17.2, §17.3: added Catalog-framing scope notes at section heads. The
    functor `F : 𝒫 → ℋ` is recast as a separately-defined construction on cell contents, NOT
    a structural property of `Π`; the `Π = ⊗ℋ_n` infinite tensor product and spectral-triple
    constructions are tagged expository.
  - Part-V §19.2: propagated the SUPERSEDED tag from Part-II §6.2 to the consistency-matrix
    formulation (per CONV-2 / Tier C6). Committed to the balance-theoretic replacement (Harary
    1953); retired the Gram-form alternative (per Math M-I8 the embedding was unspecified).
    Pinned `C_ii := +1` diagonal convention.
  - Part-V §24.1.1: added Catalog-framing scope note explaining that `‖Π_∞‖² < ∞` is, per the
    catalog framing, a per-cell condition (`‖content(c)‖² < ∞` for normalizable-content cells),
    not a global aggregate norm.
  Project name "Universal Physics Tensor" stays as a brand label; the technical content is a
  catalog, not a tensor in the multilinear-map or Hilbert-space sense. Per iter-2 SYNTHESIS.md
  CONV-1.

### Added
- **`tractability_class` field added to `BridgeEquationEntry` schema (Wave I.B D10).**
  Per CS reviewer I5 (Wave H paper review). Bridge tractability ranges
  from O(1) closed-form (BE-19, BE-25, BE-41) to formally divergent
  (BE-20 cosmological-constant integral, BE-50 distributional path
  integral) — but the schema had no field to record this distinction,
  so contributors had no machine-readable way to flag which entries
  UPT does not claim to compute. Added a new `BridgeTractabilityClass`
  enum to `src/bridges/index.ts`:
  `'closed-form' | 'numerical-tractable' | 'numerical-asymptotic' |
  'formally-divergent' | 'undefined'`. Added a non-null
  `tractability_class` field to `BridgeEquationEntry`. Populated all 40
  entries: the 9 AST-encoded bridges with concrete classes (BE-11
  closed-form, BE-14 closed-form, BE-19 closed-form, BE-22 closed-form,
  BE-25 closed-form, BE-26 numerical-tractable, BE-34 closed-form,
  BE-41 closed-form, BE-47 numerical-tractable); the remaining 31
  entries default to `'undefined'` pending future classification. New
  test block in `tests/bridges-index.test.ts` (5 tests) asserts: every
  entry has the field; values are from the valid enum; the 9 encoded
  bridges are not 'undefined'; the default is in use; the specific
  expected classes are pinned. TDD-strict (RED → GREEN). Net test
  count: 398 → 403 (+5).

### Documentation
- **Part-I §1.3 — replaced vacuous Dimensional Consistency equation (Wave I.B D11).**
  Per Mathematician M-C2 (Wave H paper review). The earlier displayed
  equation `[Π^{αβγδεζ}] = [Π^{α'β'γ'δ'ε'ζ'}] when connected by
  symmetry` was vacuous as a top-level invariant: the multi-index
  labels span genuinely different physical kinds (a Lagrangian density
  and a decoherence rate carry different SI dimensions), and "connected
  by symmetry" does not pick out a unique equivalence class on the
  catalog. The scope-note already conceded the per-equation reading.
  Replaced with a concrete per-bridge property:
  `format(infer(rhs(e))) === e.dimensional_signature` for every entry
  with a non-null signature, machine-checked by the validator and
  pinned by `tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts`. No
  code or test changes.
- **Part-I Appendix A — added Notation Glossary for cross-bridge reused symbols (Wave I.B D9).**
  Per Researcher I-6 (Wave H paper review). Symbols `α`, `β`, `γ`, `η`,
  `λ`, `μ`, `ν`, `ρ`, `σ`, `τ`, `φ`, `χ`, `ω`, `ξ`, `ζ`, `Δ`, `Λ`, `κ`
  are reused across BE-11 through BE-50 with distinct per-bridge
  meanings. Added a new "Notation Glossary" appendix at the end of
  Part-I.md listing 49 row-entries covering 18 polyvalent symbols, each
  with bridge ID, per-bridge meaning, and a literature reference. The
  table does not replace per-bridge `where:` clauses (those remain
  authoritative) — its purpose is solely to flag the polyvalence so a
  reader who sees `ξ` in BE-12 and `ξ` in BE-43 has a canonical place
  to confirm they refer to different physical quantities (coherence
  length vs wormhole circumference). Symbols with a single canonical
  meaning across the catalog (`ℏ`, `c`, `G`, `k_B`, `M_P`, `ℓ_P`, etc.)
  are explicitly omitted as unambiguous. No code or test changes.
- **Part-III §VIII — hedged informal `P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ TENSOR ⊆ EXPSPACE` complexity chain (Wave I.B D6).**
  Per CS C2 (Wave H paper review). The chain was presented as flat
  without acknowledging that TENSOR is not a formal complexity class
  (no machine model, no completeness reductions, no hardness results).
  Added a hedge paragraph immediately preceding the chain stating that
  TENSOR is illustrative, not formal; that UPT does not define a
  Turing-machine model or hardness reductions for tensor-bridge-equation
  evaluation; and that specific bridge equations have their own
  tractability classes (see Wave I.B D10 `tractability_class` field
  per BE entry — concrete and machine-checked even though TENSOR
  itself is not formalized). No code or test changes.
- **Part-IV §11.2.1 — Gödel→Wolfram irreducibility for the right bridging argument (Wave I.B D5).**
  Per Mathematician M-I (Wave H paper review). The earlier "Plausibility
  argument" invoked Gödel's incompleteness as the bridge from formal
  systems to physical computability — which is the wrong route (Gödel
  applies to consistent r.e. formal systems containing arithmetic and
  concerns derivability of *statements*, not computability of *physical
  quantities*). Rewrote to use **Wolfram computational irreducibility**
  (Wolfram 2002 *A New Kind of Science*; Israeli-Goldenfeld 2004
  *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 92:074105 — year corrected from 2006 to 2004 in
  Wave L Tier F1, per Researcher C2 iter-3) as the correct bridging argument: some
  dynamical systems (chaotic dynamics, RG flows past fixed points,
  generic many-body interactions) admit no closed-form shortcut over
  direct simulation, which is consistent with the framework's
  pervasive use of efficient algorithms (Lindblad / RT / WKB) for
  special cases. No code or test changes.
- **Part-III §VIII.1 Definition 8.1 — corrected mutual-information double-count (Wave I.B D4).**
  Per Mathematician M-I (Wave H paper review). The earlier bound
  `I(Π) ≤ Σ log_2|H_i| + Σ_{i<j} I(H_i:H_j) + Σ_{i<j<k} I(H_i:H_j:H_k)
  + ...` double-counted: it added bivariate, trivariate, etc. mutual
  information *on top of* the marginal-sum bound, but the correct
  canonical form is just the subadditivity inequality
  `I(Π) ≤ Σ_i log_2|H_i|` (Cover-Thomas §2.5, MacKay §2.5). Higher-order
  correlation terms are *deficits* below this bound (the total
  correlation / multi-information), not additive contributions above.
  Replaced the displayed bound and added prose explaining the
  inclusion-exclusion identity for total correlation. No code or test
  changes.
- **Part-IV §12.2.1.1 — promoted validator scope limits from code to spec (Wave I.B D3).**
  Per CS C4 (Wave H paper review). Part-I §IV Algorithm 1 procedures
  `VALIDATE_DIMENSIONS` and `VERIFY_GLOBAL_CONSISTENCY` (and Algorithm 3A
  `VALIDATE_TENSOR_CONSISTENCY`) overpromised: the implementation in
  `src/dimensional/validator.ts` is operator-blind (no quantum
  operators, no tensor index structure, no special-function argument
  checks, no path-integral measures), and only addresses the
  DIMENSIONAL constraint of the four listed
  (DIMENSIONAL/GAUGE/UNITARITY/CORRESPONDENCE). Added a new §12.2.1.1
  "Scope Limitations" subsection that explicitly states what the
  validator validates (scalar AST primitives over SI dimensions),
  what it does NOT validate (quantum operators, tensor indices,
  special-function args, path-integral measures), and references
  `src/dimensional/README.md` §"What's NOT in MVP" as the canonical
  list. No code or test changes.
- **Part-IV §12.2.1 — hedged "Non-Turing Computability" capability claim (Wave I.B D2).**
  Per CS C3 (Wave H paper review). The original bullet "Non-Turing
  Computability: Access to uncomputable functions" contradicted the
  framework's own pervasive use of Lindblad master equations,
  Ryu-Takayanagi prescriptions, WKB integrals, and similar
  Turing-bounded constructions. Removed the bullet and replaced the
  capabilities list with hedged language: UPT's catalog includes
  equations whose closed-form solutions are not algorithmic
  (perturbative-QED divergence, asymptotic series, distributional path
  integrals), but UPT does not claim to compute these; the framework's
  algorithmic surface (dimensional analyzer + bridge-equation catalog)
  is Turing-bounded. Non-algorithmic content is documented per-bridge
  in the `tractability_class` field (introduced in Wave I.B D10). The
  NP-Complete and Quantum-Gravity-Computation bullets are also hedged
  to acknowledge their speculative status. No code or test changes.
- **Part-I §3.2.4 — removed non-universal `C(ρ) ≤ exp(S(ρ))` bound (Wave I.B D1).**
  Per Mathematician M-C3 + CS C5 (Wave H paper review). The bound fails
  for pure states (S = 0 ⇒ exp(0) = 1, but pure states can have
  arbitrarily high circuit complexity — e.g., the output of a hard
  quantum circuit). The replacement `C(ρ) ≤ dim ℋ` is also vacuous when
  `dim ℋ` is infinite. Removed the displayed inequality from the
  fundamental-information-bounds list and replaced with prose noting
  that a general upper bound on circuit complexity in terms of entropy
  is open; operator-norm bounds (Brown-Susskind) and entropy-based
  heuristics give different scalings depending on gate set and circuit
  model. UPT does not commit to a specific bound here. Added
  Brown-Susskind 2018 (arXiv:1706.03788) reference for holographic
  complexity bounds. No code or test changes.

### Changed
- **BE-26 polymerase-fidelity gap registered as known_issue (Wave I.B C6).**
  Per Evo Biologist IMP-1 + IMP-2 (Wave H paper review). The BE-26 WKB
  tunneling formula `Γ = ν_0 · exp(-WKB) · f(T, pH, EM)` was tagged
  `established` (the WKB form is canonical), but the bare WKB rate with
  reasonable barrier parameters overshoots observed DNA mutation rates
  (~10⁻⁸-10⁻¹⁰ /bp/replication) by 2-4 orders of magnitude. The
  `f(T, pH, EM)` prefactor — labeled in the AST module as "Q10 × pH ×
  EM-perturbation" — silently absorbs the dominant biological-mechanism
  corrections (polymerase proofreading ~10⁻⁵, mismatch repair ~10²)
  without naming them. Added a `phenomenological-ansatz` /
  `reformulation`-fixable known_issue describing the gap, prescribing
  two defensible paths: factor `f = f_proofreading × f_repair ×
  f_environment` explicitly, or replace tunneling-as-mutation-mechanism
  with the mainstream polymerase-fidelity model in which
  tunneling-induced tautomers are one error source dominated by
  polymerase mistakes and corrected by repair. Updated
  `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-26 (`known_issues`), Part-II.md spec body
  Status block, and the `src/bridges/equations/be-26-dna-tunneling.ts`
  JSDoc. The `established` status is preserved (WKB is canonical); the
  framing gap is tagged at the `known_issues` level. No code changes.
- **BE-38 reformulated to canonical Milgrom MOND interpolation μ(x) = x/√(1+x²) (Wave I.B C4).**
  Per Physicist I12 (Wave H paper review). The original
  `F = F_N[1 + α√(a₀/a) tanh(√(a/a₀))]` interpolation failed the deep-MOND
  limit: in the `a → 0` limit `tanh(√(a/a₀)) ≈ √(a/a₀)`, so the bracket
  becomes `1 + α` (Newtonian), not the required `√(F_N a₀)`. Replaced
  with the canonical Milgrom 1983 (*Astrophys. J.* 270:365) MOND
  interpolation `μ(x) = x/√(1+x²)`, `x = a/a₀`, which recovers Newtonian
  scaling for `a >> a₀` and deep-MOND scaling `F → √(F_N a₀)` for
  `a << a₀` by construction. The Verlinde 2016 mass-correction variant
  (arXiv:1611.02269) and TeVeS relativistic completion (Bekenstein 2004)
  are non-equivalent reformulation paths and are documented in
  `references[]` for future work. Updated `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-38
  (`formula_latex`, `known_issues`, `notes`) and Part-II.md spec body.
  The R2-gap-spec block is replaced with a per-bridge phenomenological-
  ansatz issue that flags MOND as empirically motivated (rotation-curve
  fits) but lacking first-principles derivation. Per Wave-G honest-
  archaeology precedent, the obsolete `tests/bridges/be-38-r2-spec.test.ts`
  is deleted and replaced by `tests/bridges/be-38-reformulation.test.ts`
  (8 tests). Net test count: 395 → 398 (+3).
- **BE-31 reformulated to canonical Benincasa-Dowker d=4 form (Wave I.B C3).**
  Per Mathematician M-I + Physicist I9 (Wave H paper review). The
  original `R = (2/√π)(N/V^{2/4} - k_1 - k_2(ρ²ℓ_P⁴)^{1/4})` form had
  both a `V^{2/4}→V^{1/2}` typo and a dimensional mismatch in the
  `(ρ²ℓ_P⁴)^{1/4}` term against Ricci-scalar dimensions `[L^{-2}]`, and
  was not derivable from any standard causal-set construction. Replaced
  with the canonical Benincasa-Dowker 2010 (*Phys. Rev. Lett.*
  104:181301; arXiv:1001.2725) d=4 inclusion-exclusion formula:
  `R(p) = (4/√6) ℓ_P^{-2} [1 + N_0(p) - 9 N_1(p) + 16 N_2(p) - 8 N_3(p)]`,
  where `N_k(p)` counts causal-set inclusive intervals of cardinality
  `k+2` below `p`. The earlier R2-gap-spec block proposed a
  `/⟨n(p)⟩`-divided variant which is incorrect; the published BD form is
  additive (no sprinkling-density division). Status remains
  *speculative* — the d≠4 generalization requires re-deriving
  coefficients, and the bridge-equation framing (causal sets as UPT
  microstructure) is original to this catalog. Updated
  `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-31 (`formula_latex`, `known_issues`,
  `notes`) and Part-II.md spec body. The R1→R2-tier `dimensional`
  known_issue is replaced with a `phenomenological-ansatz`
  known_issue tagged for the framing, not the math. Per the Wave-G
  honest-archaeology precedent (BE-37 R3), the obsolete R2-pin tests
  `tests/bridges/be-31-{preserve,r2-spec}.test.ts` are deleted and
  replaced by `tests/bridges/be-31-reformulation.test.ts` (8 tests
  verifying the new canonical form). Net test count: 398 → 395 (−3).
- **BE-21 dimensional signature sign — `[L]^{2Δ−d}` → `[L]^{d−2Δ}` (Wave I.B C2a).**
  Per Mathematician M-C4 (Wave H paper review). The Part-II spec stated
  `[G_R] = [L]^{2Δ−d}`, which is the exponent of the *bulk-radial factor*
  `r^{2Δ−d}` that appears in the limit recipe — not the dimension of the
  result `G_R(ω,k)` itself. The canonical momentum-space convention is
  `[L]^{d−2Δ}`: the two-point function `⟨O(x)O(0)⟩_R ~ |x|^{−2Δ}` has
  dim `[L]^{−2Δ}`, and Fourier-transforming with d-dimensional measure
  `dt d^{d−1}x` (dim `[L]^d`) gives `G_R(ω,k)` dim `[L]^{d−2Δ}`. Updated
  Part-II spec body; BE-21 in `src/bridges/index.ts` has
  `dimensional_signature: null` (no AST module), so no round-trip test is
  involved. `notes` field expanded to record the sign correction. No
  test changes.
- **BE-19 ρ_crit reformulated to canonical Ashtekar-Pawlowski-Singh form (Wave I.B C1).**
  Per Physicist I4 (Wave H paper review), the BE-19 critical density was
  stated as `ρ_crit = 3c²/(8πGℓ_P²) ≈ 6.2×10⁹⁵ kg/m³` — a dimensional
  estimate omitting the Barbero-Immirzi γ³ factor that appears in the
  canonical Loop Quantum Cosmology derivation. Replaced with the
  Ashtekar-Pawlowski-Singh form `ρ_crit = (√3/(16π²γ³ℓ_P²))·(c²/G)`
  (Ashtekar-Pawlowski-Singh 2006 *Phys. Rev. D* 74:084003,
  arXiv:gr-qc/0607039), which uses the Barbero-Immirzi parameter γ ≈
  0.2375 (Meissner 2004 *Class. Quantum Grav.* 21:5245,
  arXiv:gr-qc/0407052, fixed by black-hole-entropy matching) and yields
  the canonical literature value cited as `≈ 0.41 ρ_Planck ≈ 2.1×10⁹⁶
  kg/m³` (Ashtekar-Singh review arXiv:1108.0893). Updated `formula_latex`
  and Part-I.md spec body. The prior `phenomenological-ansatz`
  known_issue documenting this discrepancy is removed (issue resolved by
  promotion into the canonical formula). References array gained the
  APS and Meissner papers. The AST module BE-19 takes ρ_crit as a free
  numerical input, so the formula change does not require re-encoding;
  the existing test that pinned the deprecated form's numerical value
  has been retitled "PINS deprecated spec form" and a parallel
  "PINS canonical APS form" test has been added (398 tests, +1).
- **BE-50 attribution corrected — Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory
  primary (Wave I.A C5).** Per Physicist I17 (Wave H paper review),
  BE-50 (Retrocausal Quantum Field Theory) was attributed to
  Cramer / Aharonov-Vaidman, but the Wheeler-Feynman absorber-theory
  attribution is more accurate for the Lagrangian form
  `L_forward(φ_+) + L_backward(φ_-)`. Updated `references[]` and the
  Part-II.md status block: Wheeler-Feynman 1945 *Rev. Mod. Phys.*
  17:157 is now the primary reference; Wheeler-Feynman 1949
  *Rev. Mod. Phys.* 21:425 added as the canonical companion paper;
  Cramer 1986 *Rev. Mod. Phys.* 58:647 retained as a secondary modern
  reference (the standard prose lineage from Wheeler-Feynman). The
  Aharonov-Vaidman two-state vector formalism is *removed* because it
  is a separate retrodictive-measurement formalism over standard QM,
  not a retrocausal QFT, and is not load-bearing for the action here.
  The novel `λ φ_+ φ_- δ^4(x - x_m)` coupling term remains marked as
  original to this framework. No code or test changes.
- **BE-21 citation correction — Son-Starinets vs Policastro-Son-Starinets
  disambiguated (Wave I.A C2b; venue corrected Wave J Tier C1+C2 2026-05-05).**
  Per Researcher I-1 (Wave H paper review), `arXiv:hep-th/0205052` resolves to
  *Policastro, Son & Starinets* "From AdS/CFT correspondence to hydrodynamics"
  *JHEP* 0209:043 (three-author), but the BE-21 prose attributed it to "Son and
  Starinets 2002" (two-author). The substantive content of BE-21 — the explicit
  retarded-Green's-function recipe `G_R = -i lim r^{2Δ-d} (g^rr/√g^tt) ∂_r φ /
  φ_0` — is the canonical recipe from *Son & Starinets* 2002 *JHEP* 0209:042
  (arXiv:hep-th/0205051), the genuine two-author paper. Decision: change the
  arXiv ID (0205052 → 0205051) and keep "Son and Starinets" attribution in the
  prose; preserve the companion 0205052 paper as a secondary reference (it
  applies the same recipe to hydrodynamics). **Venue corrected 2026-05-05 (Wave
  J Tier C1, per Researcher iter-2 95% conf):** the Wave I.A pass mistakenly
  recorded the venue as *Phys. Rev. D* 65:104021; verification against the
  arXiv abstract page confirms the actual venue is *JHEP* 0209:042. Iqbal-Liu
  year corrected 2008 → 2009 (Wave J Tier C2): arXiv 0903.2596 is March 2009
  and *Fortsch. Phys.* 57 is a 2009 volume. Updated `src/bridges/index.ts`
  BE-21 entry (`references[]`) and the Part-II.md status block. No code or
  test changes.
- **BE-24 `references[]` expanded (Wave I.A E4).** Per Evo Biologist
  IMP-3 (Wave H paper review), BE-24 (Quantum Coherence in
  Photosynthesis Efficiency) cited the Cao 2020 *Sci. Adv.* consensus
  update but was missing two key entries in the literature trail:
  Thyrhaug et al. 2018 *Nat. Chem.* 10:780 (the FMO 2D-spectroscopy
  reinterpretation that reassigns long-lived oscillations to
  vibrational rather than electronic coherence) and Wilkins & Dattani
  2015 *J. Chem. Theory Comput.* 11:3411 (HEOM benchmarking that
  constrains electronic-coherence-lifetime claims). Both appended to
  the existing 6-entry list. No code or test changes.
- **BE-28 `references[]` populated (Wave I.A E3).** Per Researcher I-5
  (Wave H paper review), BE-28 (Maximum Entropy Production Principle)
  shipped with empty `references[]` despite the Part-II prose body
  citing Dewar 2003/2005, the Grinstein-Linsker 2007 rebuttal, and
  Prigogine's contrasting minimum-entropy-production principle. Added
  full citations for all four. No code or test changes.
- **BE-26 `references[]` populated (Wave I.A E2).** Per Researcher I-4
  and Evo Biologist IMP-2 (Wave H paper review), BE-26 (DNA Mutation —
  Quantum Tunneling Rate) shipped with empty `references[]` despite
  the `notes` field naming Gamow 1928 and Landau-Lifshitz §50 as the
  WKB sources and Löwdin 1963 being the canonical biological
  application. Populated with: Gamow 1928 *Z. Phys.* 51:204 (alpha-decay
  tunneling), Löwdin 1963 *Rev. Mod. Phys.* 35:724 (proton tunneling in
  DNA H-bonds), Landau-Lifshitz QM §50 (canonical WKB), and Lujan,
  Williams & Kunkel 2016 *Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol.* 8:a019745
  (replication-error fidelity / polymerase proofreading + MMR — the
  competing classical-error pathway flagged by Evo Biologist IMP-2 as
  a missing review). No code or test changes.
- **BE-25 `references[]` populated (Wave I.A E1).** Per Researcher I-3
  and Neurologist C-2 (Wave H paper review), `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS[N=25]`
  shipped with `references: ['arXiv:quant-ph/9907009']` (Tegmark only)
  despite the Part-II prose body citing Penrose-Hameroff and the
  Neurologist flagging Reimers/McKemmish 2009 as mandatory follow-ups
  to Tegmark. Added Penrose & Hameroff 1996 *Math. Comput. Simul.*
  40:453 (original Orch-OR proposal), upgraded the Tegmark entry to a
  full citation, and added Reimers et al. 2009 *PNAS* 106:4219
  (Fröhlich-condensate critique) and McKemmish et al. 2009 *Phys. Rev.
  E* 80:021912 (consolidated biological-feasibility critique). No code
  or test changes.

### Documentation
- **Part-VI BEs-with-issues count corrected from actual catalog (Wave
  I.A D12).** Per Mathematician M-I (Wave H paper review), Part-VI's
  conclusion section under-counted entries with open issues. Verified
  the actual count by walking `src/bridges/index.ts` for non-empty
  `known_issues[]` arrays: 27 entries (BE 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20,
  22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 45,
  46, 49, 50; updated Wave J Tier C3 2026-05-05: BE-19 → BE-26 — Wave
  I.B C1 emptied BE-19, Wave I.B C6 added polymerase-fidelity issue to
  BE-26; **further updated Wave L Tier F2 2026-05-05 per Researcher
  C1 iter-3:** count corrected 26 → 27 — BE-29 was previously missed,
  it carries a Wave J Tier D4 known_issue and should appear in the
  list). Both the §"What remains to be done" bullet and the "Framework
  Statistics" trailer updated 24 → 26 (Wave I.A D12) and now 26 → 27
  (Wave L Tier F2) with the corrected ID list and a sentence pinning
  where the count came from. The prior list reflected a pre-Wave-G
  snapshot before R0/R1 fixes promoted BE-11/18/29/47 to R5 and R4
  narrative-only concerns were extracted into structured records.
- **Part-V §21.2 "DNA Repair" → "DNA Mutation" framing reversal (Wave
  I.A D8).** Per Evo Biologist MIN-3 (Wave H paper review), the
  Quantum-Biology-Therapeutics bullet under Part-V §21.2.1 read "DNA
  Repair Enhancement: Quantum tunneling optimization" — but BE-26's
  mechanism is mutation, not repair. Tunneling produces tautomeric
  base-pair errors; it does not repair them. Bullet retitled "DNA
  Mutation Rate" with body rewritten to clarify tunneling drives
  mutation with WKB rate competitive against polymerase proofreading
  and mismatch-repair fidelity. The §21.2 caveat block's parallel quote
  list updated correspondingly ("DNA repair enhancement" →
  "DNA mutation-rate modulation"). No code or test changes.
- **BE-39 LaTeX line-break fix (Wave I.A D7).** `formula_latex` in
  `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-39 (Asymptotic Safety) and the corresponding
  rendered-formula block in `docs/specification/Part-II.md` had a single
  backslash (`\`) between the `β_g` and `β_λ` lines of the
  `\begin{align}...\end{align}` block instead of the required double
  backslash (`\\`) line break. Without the line break the renderer
  collapses the two lines into one, garbling the output. Fixed in both
  the index entry's escaped-string source (`\\\\` in TS template literal
  → `\\` in rendered LaTeX) and the spec markdown's URL-encoded SVG src
  (`%5C` → `%5C%5C`) plus alt-text. No code or test changes.
- **Tracker housekeeping (Wave I.A F1+F2).** CHANGELOG line 211 corrected
  from "6 of 40 entries with `dimensional_signature` populated" to
  "12 of 40" — the actual count at HEAD (BE-11, 14, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26,
  29, 34, 41, 47, 48), verified via `grep -c "dimensional_signature: \`"
  src/bridges/index.ts`. `docs/planning/Bridge-Remediation-Plan.md` R5
  list at line 266 expanded from 8 to 12 entries — the summary table
  already claimed 12, but the explicit re-list omitted the 4 bridges
  whose R0/R1 fixes had promoted them to R5 (BE-11 from R0,
  BE-18/29/47 from R1). Cross-references to R0/R1 fix-history blocks
  added so the audit trail is contiguous. No code or test changes.

### Added
- **Orphan `dimensional_signature` catalog invariant test (TA-F1, Wave G QC).** New `tests/bridges/orphan-dimensional-signature.test.ts` enforces a dual invariant: every entry whose `dimensional_signature` is non-null must EITHER (a) have a registered AST module in `dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts` or (b) appear in the explicit `ORPHAN_DIMENSIONAL_SIGNATURES` allowlist `{18, 29, 48}`. The round-trip catalog test only iterates entries with AST modules, so a typo or accidental revert of an orphan signature was previously silently uncovered (BE-18 `[L^8 M^4 T^-8]`, BE-29 `[energy]`, BE-48 `[frequency]`). Test pins each orphan's exact signature, asserts no double-coverage between the encoded and orphan sets, and provides an `uncovered` diagnostic that names the offending id when a contributor adds a new `dimensional_signature` without registering or orphan-listing it.

### Changed
- **BE-22 `known_issue` severity retagged 'phenomenological-ansatz' → 'other' (CR-F4, Wave G QC).** The post-reformulation BE-22 `KnownIssue` framed the residual gap as `phenomenological-ansatz`, but the Kitaev-Preskill formula itself is canonical (not an ansatz) — the issue is the *QG-link framing* (which gravitational degree of freedom the boundary R bounds is unspecified). `'other'` is the closest correct fit from the existing `BridgeIssueSeverity` enum (`'self-refuting' | 'dimensional' | 'index-structure' | 'sign' | 'undefined-quantity' | 'phenomenological-ansatz' | 'other'`). Single-token edit to `src/bridges/index.ts` BE-22 entry; explanatory inline comment added describing the rationale. No test pinned the prior severity, so no test changes were required.
- **BE-34 (Kibble-Zurek) dimensional gap promoted from prose-in-`notes` to structured `KnownIssue` (CR-F2, Wave G QC).** The Part-II spec markdown documents that the LHS `n_defect` should have dim `[L]^(-d)` (defects per unit d-volume), not `DIMENSIONLESS` — the canonical Kibble-Zurek form is `n ~ ξ^(-d)` and a microscopic length scale (e.g. lattice spacing `a`) must appear as a `1/a^d` prefactor. BE-19 (Barbero-Immirzi γ³) and BE-25 (spurious Δx/ℓ_P) carry their gaps as `KnownIssue` entries; BE-34 was not symmetric — the prose lived only in `notes`. Added `severity: 'dimensional'`, `fixable: 'reformulation'` `KnownIssue` to BE-34 in `src/bridges/index.ts`. Updated `src/bridges/equations/be-34-kibble-zurek.ts` JSDoc to reference the new structured entry. New BE-34 test asserts `known_issues` carries at least one `dimensional` entry whose description references both `[L]^(-d)` and the `1/a^d` prefactor — string-checked so a casual edit that loses the substantive content fails the test.

### Refactored
- **BE-19 module imports cleaned (SIMP-F1 / CR-F3, Wave G QC).** `MASS` was imported from `dimensional/types.js` but never referenced in `src/bridges/equations/be-19-quantum-bounce.ts`. `LENGTH` was kept alive only by a `void LENGTH;` "speculative-future" marker — Karpathy's "no speculative abstractions" rule says delete it (`git log` carries the rationale if a future contributor needs the alternative encoding). Both imports removed; the `void LENGTH;` line replaced with a one-paragraph comment explaining the c²-rescaled Λ convention (Ryden 2nd ed. §6, Eq. 6.32) and the path to re-add LENGTH if a future encoding wants raw `Λ_[L^-2]` form. Pure cleanup — no behavior change.
- **`DimensionValidationReport` lifted from 9 byte-identical copies into `src/dimensional/validator.ts` (SIMP-F2, Wave G QC).** The shared interface (`{ ok, lhsDim, rhsDim }`) was previously redeclared identically in BE-11, BE-14, BE-19, BE-22, BE-25, BE-26, BE-34, BE-41, BE-47. Per Karpathy: single semantic meaning + 9 consumers + future encodings will use it = clean extraction. Each module now imports the type from `validator.js` (alongside `ExprNode`); the local declaration is deleted. Pure structural change — no behavior delta. Test count unchanged (396).

### Fixed (tests)
- **BE-22 Fibonacci anyon test: vacuous self-comparison replaced with cross-derivation (TA-F2, Wave G QC).** The Fibonacci anyon γ test in `tests/bridges/be-22-encoding.test.ts` previously asserted `gamma_fib.toBeCloseTo(0.6429653906383268, 12)` where the literal IS the IEEE-754 output of the JS expression `0.5 * Math.log(1 + phi*phi)` — a tautology. Replaced with two independent algebraic derivations that exercise different floating-point paths: Route A `0.5 · log(1 + φ²)` (direct) and Route B `0.5 · log((5+√5)/2)` (using φ² = φ + 1 from the Fibonacci recurrence). The new cross-check `expect(routeA).toBeCloseTo(routeB, 14)` catches an algebraic typo (e.g., `φ² = 2φ` would land routes ~0.08 apart), where the previous self-comparison passed vacuously. The literal pin is preserved as a historical anchor at digit 12 against `routeB`.

### Fixed
- **`EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` extended for the 7 new Wave-1 / Wave-2 AST encodings (CR-F1, Wave G QC).** The cross-check map in `src/dimensional/bridge-check.ts` was previously only seeded with `[11, FREQUENCY], [14, ENTROPY]`; Wave-1 added BE-19, 25, 26, 34, 41, 47 and Wave-2 added BE-22 without registering the expected dim, so `inferDimensionForBridge(id, expr)` silently fell through for 7 of 9 registered encodings. Added entries: BE-19 → `[T^-2]`, BE-22 → `DIMENSIONLESS`, BE-25 → `TIME`, BE-26 → `FREQUENCY`, BE-34 → `DIMENSIONLESS`, BE-41 → `MASS`, BE-47 → `[L^-3 T^-1]`. The bracketed-product entries (BE-19, BE-47) use ad-hoc `Dimension` literals constructed via `multiply` / `power`. New tests in `tests/dimensional/bridge-check.test.ts` cover each new id (correct AST returns the expected dim; deliberately-wrong AST returns `null`) plus a size-floor guard pinning the map to 9 entries so future encodings cannot land without a corresponding row.

### Changed
- **BE-22 (Topological Entanglement Entropy — QG Link) reformulated to canonical Kitaev-Preskill / Levin-Wen form (R2 → R5-leaning, 2026-05-05).** Replaced the originally-stated three-term form `S_topo = -γ + α log(ξ/a) + β(T/T_c)^ν log(A/ℓ_P²)` — which had area-law-doubled and finite-T extension issues and was not derivable from any standard TEE construction — with the canonical single-subsystem form `S(R) = α L(R) − γ + O(L^-1)` (Kitaev-Preskill 2006 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 96:110404, arXiv:hep-th/0510092; Levin-Wen 2006 *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 96:110405, arXiv:cond-mat/0510613). `dimensional_signature` populated `[1]` (dimensionless entropy in nats). `known_issues` collapsed from two `spec-edit` entries to one `phenomenological-ansatz` / `reformulation` entry that documents the remaining QG-link gap. References added (Kitaev-Preskill, Levin-Wen). Status remains `speculative` — the formula itself is established, but the "QG link" framing is original to this catalog and not in either reference. Spec section in `docs/specification/Part-II.md` updated with the new formula and an AST-encoding callout.
- **BE-37 (Variable Speed of Light Cosmology) status: speculative → invalid (R3 disposition, 2026-05-05).** Daniel accepted the Wave-2 disposition brief's recommendation. Two independent obstructions block reformulation: (1) Ellis-Uzan 2005 operational-meaninglessness critique (arXiv:gr-qc/0305099) — bare c(t) has no falsifiable content without specifying which c varies and which dimensionless constant ratio is changing; (2) the three canonical VSL formulations (Albrecht-Magueijo, Moffat, Barrow) are non-equivalent and none cleanly survives the Ellis-Uzan critique. Original c(t) ansatz preserved as historical record. Two known_issues with `fixable: 'unfixable-must-mark-invalid'` (`src/bridges/index.ts`). Spec section in `docs/specification/Part-II.md` and `docs/planning/Bridge-Remediation-Plan.md` updated. Replaces obsolete R2-pin tests `tests/bridges/be-37-{preserve,r2-spec}.test.ts` (deleted) with `tests/bridges/be-37-r3-disposition.test.ts` (added). Honest-archaeology pattern: disposition change requires deleting the prior pins, making the choice explicit.

### Documentation
- v0.1.0 release procedure runbook at `docs/planning/v0.1.0-Release-Procedure.md`. Documents trigger conditions, pre-cut checklist, the cut steps (CHANGELOG rename, version confirm, tag, push), post-cut tasks, and explicit anti-patterns ("do not cut because package.json already reads 0.1.0," "do not pre-write release notes"). Current-readiness section notes mechanical readiness is in place after BE-22 lands; the cut decision is the project owner's.
- BE-37 VSL Disposition Brief at `docs/planning/BE-37-VSL-Disposition-Brief.md`.
  Synthesizes the Ellis-Uzan critique (`Am. J. Phys.` 73:240, 2005;
  arXiv:gr-qc/0305099) against varying-c cosmologies and compares to the
  current BE-37 ansatz `c(t) = c_0[1 + ε(t/t_P)^n exp(-t/t_c)]`.
  Recommended call: **R3 (mark-invalid) with confidence 60**, but framed
  as a recommendation, not a decision. Brief unblocks task #98 (pending
  since Wave F). WebFetch returned only the paper abstract; the body
  argument is reconstructed from background knowledge with an explicit
  honest-claude verification flag for Daniel.
- Documented the dimensionless-stub convention for transcendental
  functions in `src/dimensional/README.md`. The AST has no `exp`/`log`/
  `sin`/etc. primitives; the convention is: encode `f · exp(arg)` as
  `f · ε` (ε a `DIMENSIONLESS` symbol), expose `arg` as a separate
  ExprNode named `<MODULE>_<FN>_ARG`, and add a lemma test asserting
  the argument is dimensionless. Used in BE-26 (`WKB_ARG`),
  BE-34 (`EXP_ARG`), BE-41 (`EXP_ARG`). Renamed two test descriptions
  ("WKB exponent..." and "Boltzmann arg...") to the canonical
  `'exp argument ... is dimensionless (lemma)'` form so the lemma
  anchor is grep-discoverable.

### Changed
- Spec ↔ AST cross-references (Wave-2 Phase B): each of the 8
  AST-encoded bridge modules (BE-11, 14, 19, 25, 26, 34, 41, 47) now
  carries `@see` JSDoc lines pointing to the relevant
  `docs/specification/Part-{I,II}.md` section and to the
  `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS` index entry. Each corresponding spec section
  carries a callout block linking back to the module file. The
  `src/bridges/README.md` now lists all 8 encoded bridges in a
  status/signature/module table with a pointer to the Tier-5 triage
  memo for the rest. 16 cross-references in total (8 bridges × 2
  directions).

### Added
- BE-22 (Topological Entanglement Entropy / Kitaev-Preskill) AST encoding at
  `src/bridges/equations/be-22-topological-entanglement.ts`. Encodes
  `S(R) = α · L(R) − γ` with α as a symbol of dim `[L^-1]`, L as dim
  `[L]`, and γ as `DIMENSIONLESS`; the `+ O(L^-1)` finite-size
  correction is dropped per encoding scope. `BE22_AREA_TERM` and
  `BE22_TOPOLOGICAL_TERM` are exposed as separate ExprNodes for
  per-term dimensional verification (both infer to `DIMENSIONLESS`).
  Numerical evaluator with bracket-checks: Z₂ toric code identity
  (γ = log 2, S = −log 2 to 1e-12); Fibonacci anyon γ = (1/2) log(1+φ²)
  ≈ 0.6429653906 hand-computed and pinned; perimeter linearity
  identity `S(2L) − S(L) = α·L` swept across 5 L values; γ-additivity
  identity. Status pinned `speculative` (the formula is established;
  the QG-link framing remains original). `dimensional_signature` set
  to `[1]`. New test file at `tests/bridges/be-22-encoding.test.ts`.
- BE-47 property tests (Wave-2 hardening): rate-balance condition (SM
  source = dark sink → dY/dt = -3HY) pinned to 1e-12; per-coupling
  linearity (dY/dt linear in <σv>_SM, <σv>_dark, ε) verified by three
  independent doubling tests; quadratic n_χ-scaling identity over 5 α
  values; Hubble-drag 10-point monotonic-decrease sweep. 4 new tests
  added to `tests/bridges/be-47-encoding.test.ts` (13 → 17).
- BE-41 property tests (Wave-2 hardening): pin second e-fold
  m(φ₀ + 2M_P/α) = m₀·e⁻² and fifth e-fold m₀·e⁻⁵; multiplicative
  e-fold-ratio identity m_{n+1}/m_n = 1/e across 6 consecutive folds;
  dense 10-point monotonic decrease sweep; α-rescaling identity
  m(α=2,Δφ=L) = m(α=1,Δφ=2L) over 5 L values. 5 new tests added to
  `tests/bridges/be-41-encoding.test.ts` (15 → 20).
- BE-34 property tests (Wave-2 hardening): scaling-power identity
  n(α·τ_Q)/n(τ_Q) = α^(-dν/(1+zν)) verified at d=ν=z=1 (α^(-1/2)) over
  6 α values and at d=3, ν=z=1 (α^(-3/2)) over 5 α values, both pinned
  to 1e-12 relative; Boltzmann factorization identity n(m,T)/n(0,T) =
  exp(-mc²/k_BT) verified across 3 masses to 1e-10; 10-point dense
  monotonicity sweep in τ_Q. 4 new tests added to
  `tests/bridges/be-34-encoding.test.ts` (16 → 20).
- BE-26 property tests (Wave-2 hardening): exact barrier-collapse
  identity (V → E → Γ = ν₀ · f) over 4 f values, exponential-decay
  ratio identity Γ(2L)/Γ(L) = exp(−(2/ℏ)pL) over 5 barrier widths
  (pinned to 1e-10 relative), and dense 10-point monotonicity sweeps
  in both V−E and barrier_width. 4 new tests added to
  `tests/bridges/be-26-encoding.test.ts` (17 → 21).
- BE-25 property tests (Wave-2 hardening): divergence sweeps for Δm → 0
  and Δx → 0 (6-point monotonic strict-growth each), pure-inverse
  identity sweeps for both Δm and Δx (8 log-spaced points each, ratio
  pinned to 1e-12 relative), and a `PINS spec known_issue` test that
  compares t_OR_spec vs. the naive Penrose self-energy form
  ℏΔx/(G(Δm)²) to make the spurious Δx/ℓ_P factor's effect explicit.
  5 new tests added to `tests/bridges/be-25-encoding.test.ts` (13 → 18).
- BE-19 property tests (Wave-2 hardening): dense-sweep monotonicity of
  H²/ρ over 10 log-spaced ρ values, machine-precision pinning of the
  classical Friedmann limit (ρ → 0, Λ = 0 → H² = (8πG/3)ρ to 1e-15
  relative), exact bounce-halt identity (ρ = ρ_crit, Λ = 0 → H² = 0),
  bounce-factor ratio identity α(2−α) over 6 α values, Λ-additivity
  superposition test over 5 Λ values, and a `PINS spec known_issue` test
  that nails down the spec's ρ_crit = 3c²/(8πG ℓ_P²) value (~6.15e95
  kg/m³) so a deliberate edit is required before promotion. 5 new
  tests added to `tests/bridges/be-19-encoding.test.ts` (14 → 19).
- BE-47 (BBN Dark-Sector-Coupling Boltzmann ODE) AST encoding at
  `src/bridges/equations/be-47-bbn-dark-sector.ts`. Full ODE encoded
  `dY/dt + 3HY = ⟨σv⟩_SM n_p n_n − ⟨σv⟩_dark n_χ² ε_transfer` with
  every term (dY/dt, 3HY, SM source, dark sink) exposed as a separate
  ExprNode and per-term dim verified `[L^-3 T^-1]`. Numerical evaluator
  with bracket-checks for pure Hubble dilution, pure SM source, pure
  dark sink, and full balance (dY/dt = 0). Status pinned `speculative`
  (base form canonical Kolb-Turner; dark-sector term is the unverified
  extension). `dimensional_signature` was already `[L^-3 T^-1]` (R1
  hand-encoded); the AST now backs it.
- BE-26 (DNA Mutation Quantum Tunneling Rate / WKB) AST encoding at
  `src/bridges/equations/be-26-dna-tunneling.ts`. Encodes
  `Γ = ν₀ exp[−(2/ℏ)∫√(2m(V−E))dx] · f(T,pH,EM)`. The WKB exponent is
  fully encoded via the AST `integral` primitive with `^` of 0.5 for the
  square root, exposed as `DNA_TUNNELING_WKB_ARG` and verified
  dimensionless via lemma test. Bracket-check with proton mass / 0.4 eV
  barrier / 1 Å width gives Γ ~ 10 /s — squarely in the textbook
  10^-3 to 10^3 /s range for hydrogen-bond proton transfer (Löwdin 1963;
  Gamow 1928; Landau-Lifshitz QM §50). Status pinned `established`.
  `dimensional_signature` set to `[frequency]`.
- BE-34 (Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in Curved Spacetime) AST encoding at
  `src/bridges/equations/be-34-kibble-zurek.ts`. Encodes
  `n_defect = (τ_Q/τ_0)^(−dν/(1+zν)) · exp(−m c²/(k_B T_reh))` with a
  canonical (d=ν=z=1) numeric exponent for the AST `^` op (dimensional
  answer is exponent-agnostic). Boltzmann argument exposed as
  `KIBBLE_ZUREK_EXP_ARG` and verified dimensionless. Numerical evaluator
  with bracket-checks: τ_Q=τ_0 → n=1, slow-quench scaling, hand-computed
  τ_Q=10 case (n=10^-1.5). Status pinned `established`.
  `dimensional_signature` set to `[1]`.
- BE-41 (Swampland Distance Conjecture) AST encoding at
  `src/bridges/equations/be-41-swampland.ts`. Encodes
  `m(φ) = m₀ · exp(−α|φ−φ₀|/M_P)` as `m₀ · ε` where ε is a dimensionless
  symbol stub for the exp factor (the AST has no `exp` primitive); the
  exp argument is exposed separately as `SWAMPLAND_EXP_ARG` and verified
  dimensionless via a lemma test. Numerical evaluator with bracket-checks
  (φ = φ₀ → m₀ identity, φ → ∞ tower descent, |φ−φ₀| = M_P/α → m₀/e).
  Status pinned `speculative`. `dimensional_signature` set to `[mass]`.
- BE-25 (Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR collapse time) AST encoding at
  `src/bridges/equations/be-25-orch-or.ts`. Encodes the spec-as-written
  scalar identity `t_OR = ℏ ℓ_P / (Δm c² Δx)`, with numerical evaluator
  and bracket-checks. Status pinned `highly-speculative`; the
  documented spec issue (spurious Δx/ℓ_P factor vs. Penrose's
  E_G ~ G(Δm)²/Δx) is preserved unchanged. `dimensional_signature` set
  to `[time]`.
- BE-19 (Quantum Bounce / LQC modified Friedmann) AST encoding at
  `src/bridges/equations/be-19-quantum-bounce.ts`. Encodes
  `H² = (8πG/3)ρ(1 − ρ/ρ_crit) + Λ/3` as a scalar relation, with
  numerical evaluator and bracket-checks against ρ = ρ_crit (→ Λ/3 limit)
  and ρ << ρ_crit, Λ = 0 (→ classical Friedmann limit). Status pinned
  `speculative`; the spec issue (ρ_crit vs canonical Ashtekar-Singh value
  with Barbero-Immirzi γ factor) is preserved unchanged.
  `dimensional_signature` set to `[T^-2]`.
- `tests/bridges/dimensional-signature-catalog.test.ts` — catalog-wide
  invariant test: every BE entry whose AST RHS is encoded in
  `src/bridges/equations/` must round-trip through the dimensional
  analyzer back to the registered `dimensional_signature` string.
  Currently covers BE-11 and BE-14; auto-extends as Tier-5 AST encodings
  land (test-analyzer F12).
- `isActiveStatus(status)` typed predicate exported from
  `src/bridges/index.ts`. Returns `true` for `established | speculative
  | highly-speculative`, `false` for `invalid`. Use as
  `BRIDGE_EQUATIONS.filter((e) => isActiveStatus(e.status))` to exclude
  deprecated/self-refuting entries (BE-16 today) from active-research
  summaries (type-design Critical-Hole).
- Catalog-level R2 invariant: any entry whose `notes` contains a "What
  would unblock a real fix" block has only `reformulation`-fixable
  known issues and is not `'established'` (test-analyzer F5).
- Catalog-level cross-field invariant: `status: 'invalid'` ⇔ ≥1
  `known_issue` with `fixable: 'unfixable-must-mark-invalid'`
  (type-design F-02).
- `tests/bridges/spec-vs-index.test.ts` — closes the spec↔index drift
  gap. For each entry whose `notes` advertise a "Corrected on
  YYYY-MM-DD" or "R2 reformulation gap" block, parses the spec
  markdown section and asserts the corresponding marker appears there
  too. Catches the class of bug where a contributor updates the spec
  but forgets the index, or vice versa (test-analyzer F4).

### Changed
- `inferDimensionForBridge(bridgeId, expr)` now consults the new
  `EXPECTED_DIMENSION_BY_BRIDGE` lookup map. When the id is registered
  (BE-11 → FREQUENCY, BE-14 → ENTROPY at HEAD), the inferred dim is
  cross-checked against the expected and a mismatch returns `null`.
  Unknown ids fall through to the inferred dim unchanged. The previously
  unused `bridgeId` parameter is now load-bearing
  (`src/dimensional/bridge-check.ts`).
- `src/dimensional/README.md` updated to reflect Tier-5 progress: 12 of
  40 entries now have `dimensional_signature` populated (BE-11, 14, 18,
  19, 22, 25, 26, 29, 34, 41, 47, 48), BE-11/14 have full AST encodings,
  and `inferDimensionForBridge` is now the cross-checking entry point.
- `src/bridges/README.md` and `src/bridges/index.ts` header updated:
  the previous "`dimensional_signature` is null for every entry" claim
  was no longer true (6 entries are populated). The corrected text
  also pins that populated strings are exactly what `format()` emits,
  never free-form prose (comment-analyzer #1, #2).
- BE-16 `known_issues` de-duplicated. The three records (severities
  `self-refuting`, `sign`, `undefined-quantity`) previously carried an
  identical 1500-char combined description; each now carries the
  per-severity slice of the original text. The spec markdown's
  `**Known issues:**` paragraph remains the archival source
  (comment-analyzer #3 — extractor artifact).
- BE-18 `dimensional_signature` corrected from `'[energy]^4'` to
  `'[L^8 M^4 T^-8]'`. The framework's `format()` does not synthesise
  named-power forms like `[energy]^4`; the canonical bracketed product
  is what an AST-based round-trip will actually produce
  (`src/bridges/index.ts`).
- BE-47 `dimensional_signature` corrected from
  `'[number-density][time]^-1'` to `'[L^-3 T^-1]'`. There is no
  `number-density` entry in `NAMED_DIMENSIONS`, and `format()` does not
  emit two-bracket concatenated forms anywhere; the bracketed product
  is the canonical output for the L^-3 T^-1 shape
  (`src/bridges/index.ts`).
- BE-48 `dimensional_signature` corrected from `'[time^-1]'` to
  `'[frequency]'`. The framework's `NAMED_DIMENSIONS` lookup picks
  `frequency` for the {T:-1, ...} shape, so `format()` always emits
  `'[frequency]'`; `'[time^-1]'` is not a form `format()` produces.
  Aligns with BE-11 which already uses `'[frequency]'` for the same
  Lindblad-rate signature
  (`src/bridges/index.ts`, `tests/bridges/be-48-fix.test.ts`).
- BE-11 monotonicity test replaced with a dense 10-point λ sweep and a
  quadratic-ratio identity test (4 α values, 12-decimal precision). The
  previous 3-point monotonic check trivially fit any function with a
  hidden bump (test-analyzer F7).
- BE-14 Schwarzschild test no longer self-cross-checks against the same
  formula. Replaced with a hand-computed CODATA literal (1.4467e54 J/K
  to ±0.5%); the derivation is shown in a comment block so a future
  CODATA revision that nudges k_B, G, or ℏ at the 4th sig fig will
  surface as a test failure (test-analyzer F8).
- New catalog test pins the 15 canonical category-letter → name
  mappings against the spec (`### Category X: <Name>` headers in
  docs/specification/Part-{I,II}.md). The previous unique-counts test
  would silently pass a wholesale rename; this one wouldn't
  (test-analyzer F11).
- New test for `validateEquation`: when LHS itself has an internal
  violation, the surfaced violation's `location` is prefixed with
  `lhs` (test-analyzer F13). Pure test addition — the path-prefix
  logic already works correctly, this pins it against future drift.
- Two new dimensional-algebra tests: `(a * b) / a = b` (multiply ∘
  divide commutes), and `(L^2)^(1/2) = L` (fractional exponents work).
  The fractional exponent path was previously untested (only 0, 1,
  -1, 2 were exercised); both pass without code changes
  (test-analyzer F14).
- Three `format()` tests for LENGTH, ENERGY, inverse-time replaced
  their disjunctive matchers (`'[L]' || includes('length')` etc.) with
  single-branch pins to the actual deterministic output (`'[length]'`,
  `'[energy]'`, `'[frequency]'`). The disjunctive form silently
  accepted a future refactor that flipped the rendering; the pin
  doesn't (test-analyzer F6).
- Renamed two enum-validation tests in `tests/bridges-index.test.ts`
  to "runtime values match the TS enum (catches `as` casts)" with a
  comment explaining their actual scope. Their previous "all X are
  valid enum values" phrasing read as a behavioural check but was
  really a runtime-cast guard (test-analyzer F10).

### Fixed
- `validator.infer()` no longer crashes with `TypeError` when an `^` op
  node is passed zero or one arguments. The `^` branch now records a
  shape violation and returns `null` if `args.length !== 2`, matching
  the defensive style used by the other operator branches
  (`src/dimensional/validator.ts`).
- `validator.infer()` now exhaustively guards `switch (node.kind)` with a
  `default` arm. A malformed AST whose `kind` is not one of the four
  supported variants previously caused `validate()` to silently report
  `ok: true, inferredDimension: undefined`; it now records an "unknown
  ExprNode.kind" violation and returns `ok: false`. `validate()` also
  hardens the `ok` guard against an `undefined` inferred dim
  (`src/dimensional/validator.ts`).
- `validator.infer()` `integral` / `derivative` arms guard against missing
  required fields (`integrand`/`over` and `of`/`wrt` respectively).
  Hand-built or JSON-loaded nodes that omit a field used to crash with
  `TypeError`; they now record a shape violation and return `null`
  (`src/dimensional/validator.ts`).
- `validator.infer()` `^` non-symbol-exponent violation now reports the
  inferred exponent-expression dimension in `actual` (instead of
  `DIMENSIONLESS === expected`, which made the violation look like a
  no-op to consumers comparing the two). Falls back to `DIMENSIONLESS`
  only if the exponent expression itself fails inference cleanly
  (`src/dimensional/validator.ts`).

### Removed
- 8 unused named-dimension constants from `src/dimensional/types.ts`
  and `src/index.ts` re-exports: `VOLUME`, `MOMENTUM`,
  `ANGULAR_MOMENTUM`, `PRESSURE`, `DENSITY`, `VOLTAGE`,
  `ELECTRIC_FIELD`, `MAGNETIC_FIELD`. None had any non-self reference
  in `src/` or `tests/`. Their `NAMED_DIMENSIONS` rows were removed
  too, so `format()`'s lookup table now maps only to dimensions with
  active consumers. Re-add precisely when a bridge encoding or test
  references one (simplifier F-01).
- The `'angular_momentum'` row in `NAMED_DIMENSIONS` is replaced by
  `'action'` (same SI shape J·s). `hbar` is the canonical action-typed
  consumer, so when `format()` renders that shape it now returns
  `'[action]'` rather than `'[angular_momentum]'`.
